"(Adds comments on eastern Ukraine status, rights in Crimea) BRATISLAVA, April 4 (Reuters) - Both sides in the conflict in Ukraine could pull back weapons under 100mm calibre from the front line in a bid to boost confidence in a ceasefire, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Saturday. Lavrov said there was a common aim for a ceasefire in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions agreed in Minsk in February to hold indefinitely, although there have been some violations. Lavrov said parties involved in the conflict as well as the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe were discussing what could be done on the top of the Minsk agreement which, among other measures, involved the pullback of weapons with calibre over 100mm, including large artillery, heavy mortar and powerful rocket systems. ""It is necessary to monitor keeping mainly the military part of the Minsk agreements....There is a possibility to pull back troops with calibre under 100mm,"" Lavrov said. ""We will try to help the sides to reach such an agreement, which would increase mutual confidence,"" Lavrov told a news conference during a visit to Slovakia. His remarks echoed comments by a Kiev official last week that weapons not covered by the Minsk agreements, such as tanks and 80mm mortar and other weapons of up to 100mm calibre may be pulled back. He criticised a Ukrainian law on the status of eastern Ukraine which he said went in the opposite direction than the Minsk ceasefire agreements. Ukraine's parliament voted on in March to offer limited self-rule to pro-Russian rebels in the east. But Kiev's insistence that the law should come into force only when elections are held in the eastern territories under Ukrainian jurisdiction drew immediate criticism from Russia. Asked about the rights of Crimea Tatars after Russia's annexation of Crimea last year Lavrov said they had full rights to use their language and were represented in power structures.

"(Adds quote from rebel commander) KIEV, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Ukraine's military said on Sunday pro-Russian rebels had shelled Ukrainian positions ten times since a ceasefire came into effect at midnight, but that the truce was in general being observed. The ceasefire, negotiated in four-power talks on Thursday, foresees the creation of a neutral buffer zone and withdrawal of heavy weapons responsible for many of the 5,000 deaths in a conflict that has caused the worst crisis in Russia-West relations since the Cold War a generation ago. ""As of the morning of February 15, there have been ten shelling attacks on our positions by rebels - mainly in the area of Debaltseve,"" spokesman Anatoly Stelmach said by telephone. At around 0700 GMT a Reuters witness in east Ukraine heard the sound of heavy artillery fire coming from the direction of Debaltseve, a key transport hub where government forces have been hard pressed by encircling separatists. Another military spokesman, Vladyslav Seleznyov, said the ceasefire was being observed in general. ""Shelling (by rebels) has been not regular and (has been) localised,"" he said. Separatist news service DAN quoted a senior rebel commander as saying rebels had opened fire in defence, after Ukrainian forces had violated the ceasefire around Debaltseve."

"* France says sanctions on Russia could come this week * U.S. crude stocks seen up 2.2 mln barrels last week - poll * North Korean-flagged crude tanker leaves Libya, rebels say (Updates prices) By Ron Bousso LONDON, March 11 (Reuters) - Brent oil futures rose further above $108 a barrel on Tuesday, supported by building tensions in the Ukraine crisis as the West threatened sanctions against Russia as early as this week. But concerns over demand growth in the world's two biggest oil consumers, the United States and China and rising U.S. supplies kept prices under pressure. Brent futures traded 17 cents higher at $108.25 a barrel by 1427 GMT. U.S. crude was down 32 cents at $100.80 a barrel. In the worst East-West standoff since the Cold War, France said sanctions against Russia could be imposed as early as this week if Moscow failed to respond positively to an initiative to calm the crisis. Ukraine said it would raise a new national guard force in response to Russian attempts to annex Crimea, a day after a pro-Russian force opened fire while seizing a Ukrainian military base there. The Crimean regional assembly last week called for a referendum on March 16 on joining Russia. Kiev has branded the move illegal. ""Although events in the Ukraine were not the headline maker yesterday there were no signs of any sort of diplomatic breakthrough,"" PVM chief analyst David Hufton said. ""If anything the confrontation worsened with Russia tightening its grip on the Crimea. If the referendum goes ahead next Sunday a selloff later in the week has to be budgeted for."" Oil is also drawing support from the worsening crisis in Libya. A North Korean-flagged tanker that loaded crude oil at a rebel-held port in eastern Libya moved to international waters, rebels and state oil company officials said. If confirmed, the news would be a huge embarrassment for the government after top officials including Prime Minister Ali Zeidan said late on Monday the navy had seized the tanker and would escort it to a harbour controlled by Tripoli. ""Given the latest escalation, a peaceful and permanent end to the blockade of the oil terminals appears more remote than ever, making any normalization of Libyan oil production in the near future unrealistic,"" Commerzbank analysts said. DEMAND RISKS Indicating a weak demand outlook, U.S. crude inventories are expected to have risen last week as a bitter cold spell ends and as refiners take down plants for scheduled maintenance. That forecast followed data from China showing a sharp drop in exports, pointing to weak economic activity. Other risk assets such as Asian markets and base metals found their feet after a rocky ride the previous session, though uncertainty about the true state of China's economy kept the mood brittle. Traders were also eyeing OPEC's monthly supply-and-demand report on Wednesday, which will be followed by that of the International Energy Agency on Friday.

Speaking at a meeting with public activists in Mariupol on 30 July, Taruta said that to meet that end parliament would need to pass two laws enabling cities in Donetsk Region to begin to independently formulate their budgets and plan their expenditures as soon as in 2015. The governor has said that there is a lot of talk about decentralization in Ukraine but no steps are actually taken. He also said that for Donbass this could be a way to survive. According to Taruta, government decentralisation and ability to formulate budgets bottom-up would speed up business development. He noted that local communities should be making decisions on how, when and how much of the revenue raised by the cities would be spent. Now these decisions are still being passed by officials creating a basis to expand corruption schemes. ""How can one pay taxes [to the entity] from which the taxes will be stolen?"" a manager of a Mariupol-based enterprise, Roman Azarov asked Taruta. Azarov added that until recently Mariupol entrepreneurs, for a word spoken against the ruling authorities, in the best-case scenario could have had their business taken from them, or, in the worst-case scenario, could have been thrown to jail.

According to the website donpress.com, this funding was provided owing to an additional subsidy from the state budget and was intended to partially compensate energy and utility costs for the entities in question.

The management of the company decided to suspend its operation, although the coal mine still maintains its vital functions by pumping out water and ventilating underground spaces left after the extraction of coal. These functions will be supported by a crew of employees living nearby and would not have to commute through the areas of fighting on their way to work. Other employees had to take a planned leave or a leave without pay, with their jobs to be kept for them.

They appeal to people for help rather than rely on the state. A woman refugee from Donetsk, Anna, told 0629.com.ua that she arrived in Mariupol with her little son. ""Kind people gave us shelter near the railway station. But we cannot live with them forever. Last week I went to the center for social services for families, children and youth. There we were told that there was not any housing available. Each refugee was given a package of buckwheat and two loo-rolls,"" the woman said. ""Back in early July, I registered to receive 1,000 hryvnyas [about 83 dollars] in aid from the Donetsk regional state administration, but nobody has handed us this thousand yet. I am running out of money, and I cannot find a job. I called up the realtors but they ask at least 3,000 hryvnyas [about 250 dollars] for an apartment. In addition, they charge the same amount as their commission,"" a mother of two children, Nataliya, told 0629.com.ua. Luhansk resident Olha could never imagine being a refugee, after 18 years of work in a travel company. ""We were not allowed to work, the terrorists cut us off from the Internet, and set up their TV channel next to our office. The chairman of Melekynå village council helped us, having put us in a pension,"" the woman said. According to the director of the center for social services for families, children and youth, Uliyana Tokareva, the center succeeded to settle 390 refuges in hostels and in a boarding school, 91 persons were provided with free accommodation by Mariupol residents. ""If migrants are in need of accommodation, we help them,"" Tokareva said. She added that Donetsk Region was not participating in the government-run migrant support program, and, therefore, it was not receiving relevant funding. ""We can help refugees only with what people, entrepreneurs bring over. At the center, the refugees are advised to go to other regions where the government program is underway, even though it has not been funded yet.

"Analysis & Opinion AUTHOR: PUBDATE: January 07, 2015 06:13:46 ( Australia ABC News) - The world is losing its ability to prevent conflicts and the lack of ""effective leadership"" has led to the worst displacement situation since World War II, the UN refugee chief has warned. Antonio Guterres, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, said the twin crises in Iraq and Syria had created a serious displacement situation and the world showed no effective leadership to address the challenges. ""The Syria and Iraq mega-crises, the multiplication of new crises and the old crises that seem never to die, have created the worst displacement situation in the world since World War II,"" Mr Guterres said in an address to the annual meeting of Turkey's ambassadors stationed abroad. He said over the last year, more than 13 million people have been displaced by the conflicts in Syria and Iraq. Meanwhile, the crisis deepened in South Sudan spreading across the border into Chad while the situation aggravated in Libya and a new crisis emerged in Ukraine, he added. The international community has largely lost its capacity to prevent conflicts and solve conflicts. ""What this shows is that the international community has largely lost its capacity to prevent conflicts and solve conflicts,"" Mr Guterres said. ""This is a world where indeed unpredictability and impunity are rules of the game. This is a world where there is no effective leadership. ""This is a world where conflicts multiply and the old ones are not solved and the result is, of course, a dramatic impact from the humanitarian point of view."" Mr Guterres said in June that the number of people driven from their homes by conflict and crisis has now topped 50 million for the first time since World War II. However he praised Turkey's ""generous open-door policy"" to accept refugees fleeing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime and Islamist militants. Turkey, a vocal critic of the regime in Damascus, is home to 1.7 million Syrian refugees - some of them are settled in camps near the border but many more are scattered throughout the country. Turkish foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said the government spent $US5 billion on refugees alone and lamented that the international community's contribution stood at a ""modest level"" calling for ""genuine partnership and burden-sharing"".

"Analysis & Opinion AUTHOR: PUBDATE: November 06, 2014 23:43:12 (BK - Australia ABC News) - Ukraine says anyone crossing in or out of areas controlled by pro-Russian separatists in the east of the country will have to show a passport. The rule, announced by the border guards service, was aimed at sealing off the separatist region in what will de facto become an internal border in the seven-month conflict. Ukrainian citizens will be allowed to travel in and out of the area ""on condition of showing passports"", the border guards service said in a statement. Foreigners will ""be sent to filtration points to determine the purpose of their visit"" and will have ""to show a passport or the required visa"", the statement added. Officials said the passport regime would apply to the area of what the government called the ""anti-terrorist operation"", but did not specify the exact outlines of the area. The rule appeared to signal the creation of an increasingly formal border between the Russian-backed separatist zone and the rest of Ukraine. Officials stressed this did not mean Ukraine was abandoning the separatist east, but rather boosting its defences in a war with the Russian-backed guerrillas. ""This is Ukrainian territory, but given that militants are temporarily controlling it, we have to carry out the necessary controls,"" Sergiy Astakhov, an aide to the border guards head, said. ""It is also connected with the fact that armed Russians are freely entering these territories through checkpoints on the Ukrainian-Russian frontier that are controlled by militants. ""We have to take measures so that they cannot go beyond the zone of the anti-terrorist operation."" This was the second major announcement in two days on the central government's strategy of cutting the separatist area off from the rest of the country. On Wednesday, the prime minister said that subsidies and social payments, including pensions, would be halted to rebel-controlled areas. As tensions over Ukraine continue to hurt relations between Moscow and Washington, Russia has confirmed it will not attend the 2016 Nuclear Security Summit, a gathering championed by US president Barack Obama. Russia accused Washington of seeking to play first fiddle on matters of nuclear safety and claimed organisers wanted to accord special rights to the United States along with South Korea and the Netherlands, which hosted previous summits, while discriminating other participants. ""We shared with our American colleagues our doubts regarding the added value of a forum that is planned to be held in the United States in 2016,"" Russian's foreign ministry said. It took issue with the fact that the final documents of the Washington summit would set the agenda for international organisations including the United Nations, the International Atomic Energy Agency and Interpol. ""We believe it is unacceptable to create a precedent of such outside interference into the work of international organisations,"" the foreign ministry said in a statement. ""Washington is trying to assume the role of the main and privileged 'player' in this field."" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said earlier this week Washington regretted Russia's decision not to participate in last week's preparatory meeting for the summit. ""As far as the United States is concerned, the door remains open to Russia joining future meetings like this,"" Mr Earnest said. ""And we certainly would welcome Russia making a tangible and constructive contribution to that effort."" Moscow is locked in a confrontation with the West over its support for separatists in neighbouring Ukraine, with Washington and Brussels introducing several rounds of sanctions against Russia, the toughest punitive measures since the end of the Cold War.

"As EU envoys go back and forth to Kiev, novelist Andrey Kurkov says few people know who they are and that the protest is no longer about Europe. The writer, best known for his satire Death and the Penguin, spoke to EUobserver by phone on Wednesday (5 February) amid a visit by EU foreign affairs chief Catherine Ashton and ahead of another trip by EU commissioner Stefan Fuele. “There is not much information about their visits and most people don’t know who they are. Among those who do know, quite a lot them think they do not take Ukraine seriously, that they come here to show their own public that they care about what’s going on,” he said. He noted the EU diplomats get coverage almost exclusively on internet media. But TV and radio is dominated by government messages, for instance, that protests are preventing authorities from paying people’s pensions, or that Nato is sending tanks into western Ukraine. Kurkov, the vice-president of a Ukrainian writers’ group, PEN, became politically involved when PEN in an open letter in January called for EU sanctions. He lives in Kiev and walks through the “Maidan” protest camp in the city centre each morning on the way to his office. He said the protests began as a reaction to President Viktor Yanukovych’s rejection of an EU treaty last November, but have a different agenda two months down the line. “The question of Europe was long forgotten in December and now it is all about a general dissatisfaction with the state of affairs in Ukraine,” he noted. He said that when he wrote Death and the Penguin, a story about an obituary writer who gets entangled with the mafia, in 1996 Ukraine was plagued by street crime, but now the criminals have moved from the street to parliament. “Corruption is the main problem: financial corruption, but also moral corruption, the fact that, in 90 percent of cases, you have to pay bribes to get basic government services - this is what irritates people,” he noted. “Clever people think the country is being run by idiots,” he added. “Yanukovych is mostly silent, but when he speaks, he sounds like a joke. He was recently asked who is his favourite Ukrainian poet and he said ‘Anton Chekhov’ [a Russian short story writer and dramatist],” Kurkov said. He noted the Maidan is becoming more introverted. “The people in the camp are not as open as they used to be. They are not sociable anymore. They have their own daily routine, which begins every morning with the singing of the Ukrainian national anthem, then a church service, then cleaning up the streets around Independence Square. It’s like a state within a state,” he said. With Ashton and Fuele concentrating on talks between Yanukovych and opposition MPs Vitali Klitschko, Arseniy Yatsenyuk and Petro Poroshenko, Kurkov indicated that none of the three men have popular support. He said the opposition movement has yet to produce its own leader, such as Lech Walesa in Poland in the 1980s, a shipyard worker who captured people’s imagination. Kurkov noted that Yulia Tymoshenko, the jailed former PM, could play the role if she got out, but that she is dangerous. “She is a very powerful speaker and she might well lead the revolution into a bloody phase. She has the image of a martyr and she would be taken much more seriously. People believe that once she is back in power, she would put Yanukovych and his team in prison, and this is what they want,” he said. He warned that a political deal between the government and the current opposition elite, such as Yatsenyuk or Poroshenko, is unlikely to see protests end. “They won’t go home until they see some kind of real change,” he noted. Kurkov believes the west of Ukraine, which is dominated by Roman Catholic native Ukrainian speakers, has become ungovernable. “People in western Ukraine are not going to accept a ruling party [in Kiev] and its local bosses telling them what to do. You could even see [armed] partisans, as you did after 1945 … there will be permanent defiance,” he said, referring to the anti-Soviet resistance in Ukraine after World War II. Kurkov, a 43-year-old Russian who was born in St. Petersburg, said eastern Ukraine is more complex. He noted that many russophone Ukrainians support the Maidan, however: “Kiev-based Russian speakers are bringing firewood and food to the camp even if few of them are joining in the protests.” “But there is no stereotype which fits Russian speakers. People in Crimea have announced that it should become an autonomous republic and join Russia. Then you have Russian speakers in Donbass, who love Yanukovych but who feel betrayed by Russia. People in Kharkiv, where lots of the intelligentsia live, are definitely against Yanukovych, but they are also against chaos. They have a post-Soviet mentality which values stability above all else,” he explained. He said the EU should impose financial sanctions on Yanukovych’s inner circle and drop visa requirements for ordinary Ukrainians if it wants to help. The US already imposed visa bans on some top officials, gaining recognition on the Maidan. The European Parliament will, in a resolution to be voted on Thursday, call for similar measures. But for his part, Fuele, speaking to MEPs in Strasbourg on Wednesday, said neither of Kurkov’s ideas are on the cards. “Our plan is based on engagement not sanctions,” Fuele noted. “We do not see any progress [on visa-free talks], not because of us, but because of the Ukrainian authorities,” he added. The protests have calmed down following the violent clashes of late January. Kurkov noted that there is an underground mall under the Maidan camp, where banks, shops, and restaurants are open for business as if nothing had happened. “People in Kiev are just living their daily life, with the expectation that the central part of Kiev has become a permanent settlement, with designated battlegrounds, barricades, where there is a front line between radical protesters and police,” he said. The novelist predicts the most likely scenario is that the political stalemate will cause the government to go bankrupt, opening the door to a Russian takeover. “Lots of Ukrainian businesses have already gone bust because the state is not paying them for goods and services,” he noted. “When the sovereign default is announced and the country is in ruins, neither Europe nor Russia will want to acquire Ukraine because it will be too expensive to restart its economy,” he said. “Russia will change its policy: Our main assets will be bought up by Russian oligarchs who take instructions from the Kremlin and we will become a colony with no political voice.”"

"BEIJING, March 10 -- The international community on Sunday called for a diplomatic solution to the ongoing Ukrainian and the establishment of an international contact group. Chinese President Xi Jinping and German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Sunday discussed the Ukraine crisis in a phone conversation. Xi said that as the current situation in Ukraine is very complicated and highly sensitive, various factors should be taken into consideration in the handling of the crisis. He called on all parties concerned to exercise restraint and seek a political solution through dialogue and negotiations within the framework of law and order, so as to avoid further escalation of the situation. China supports the international community's efforts and mediation, Xi said, voicing the hope that Germany would continue to communicate with other relevant parties and further play a constructive role. China is willing to keep contact with Germany on the issue, he said. Merkel said Germany hopes for an appropriate solution through dialogue, adding that her country attaches importance to China's role and is willing to strengthen communication with China on the issue. She also held phone talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday and pointed out the urgency of establishing an international contact group, which will find a political way to end the conflict in Ukraine, German government spokesman Steffen Seibert said. As Germany's partner in Europe, Britain expressed its will, along with their European and American partners, to work with Russia to find a diplomatic solution to the situation in Ukraine, including Crimea, through a phone call between British Prime Minister David Cameron and Putin. Cameron also urged Putin to de-escalate the situation in Ukraine and to support the formation of a ""contact group"" that could lead to what Britain described as ""direct talks between the governments of Russia and Ukraine,"" according to a Downing Street spokesperson. Putin agreed that a diplomatic solution is in all their interests and he would discuss the proposals on the contact group issue with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Monday. While the world calls for diplomatic solutions to the crises, the U.S. are taking steps to impose sanctions on Russia over the latter's recent moves in Ukraine's Crimea. Former U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates Sunday applauded the dispatch of additional fighter aircraft for the air patrols in the Baltic States of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, but he said that the additional measures will not deter Russia. ""Some of the sanctions that are being discussed and the actions being taken, whether it's limitations on visas or on travel or on potentially freezing assets of specific individuals, frankly I don't believe are going to be any deterrent for Putin,"" Gates told host Chris Wallace on Fox News. The Ukrainian political crisis, which originated from public anger over ousted President Viktor Yanukovych's decision in November last year to put on hold an association agreement with the European Union in order to get the Russian aid, took an abrupt turn last month as a result of bloody clashes between protestors and police. Ukraine's autonomous republic of Crimea became the epicenter of an ongoing tension in the East European country. The Crimean parliament on Thursday voted to join Russia and a referendum on Crimea's status would be held on March 16. Commenting on the simmering tensions in Crimea, Russia said last Friday that they did not expect a new cold war and the West and Moscow could seek some common ground to solve the Ukraine crisis through dialogue. Referring to the scheduled referendum on March 16, Russia said it reflected the common will of the Crimean people.

"Berlin/Moscow: Debts running into billions, economic debacle, the ruble in free fall: Russia’s collapse is accelerating – and is turning into a steadily growing danger to Russian President Vladimir Putin, aged 62, himself! BILD newspaper has learned that NATO is no longer ruling out the possibility of Putin being ousted next year. High-ranking experts are already playing through scenarios for the post-Putin era. Western strategists believe that the powerful oligarchs will have put Putin under so much pressure over the sanctions and their loss of profits by the end of 2015 that he will have to go – requiring a “fresh start for the purpose of rescuing Russia.” THIS WOULD AMOUNT TO A COUP! In fact, the past few months have seen the Kremlin beset with a power struggle, similar to those of the Soviet era. Along with the oligarchs, hardliners calling for a return to the command economy are also putting Putin under pressure. For this reason, Putin’s removal is also considered possible in German government circles. CDU [Christian Democratic Union] foreign policy specialist Karl-Georg Wellmann, aged 62, told BILD that the crisis in Russia’s economy and society is posing an ever-greater threat to the Kremlin leadership around Putin. So Will the Kremlin Chief Soon Be History? The situation in his country is certainly getting more and more fraught with every day that passes: * Russian firms now have foreign debts to the tune of 600 billion dollars (492 billion euros). 100 billon dollars will be due for repayment in 2015. * The currency reserves have plummeted to less than 400 billion dollars (328 billion euros). * The economy will shrink by 4.5 percept during 2015! * Inflation is once again more than 10 percent, for the first time since 2009. The price of vodka, the “people’s food,” has increased by 30 percent within the space of one year. Putin has now had the price of vodka frozen, in order to avoid irking his compatriots even further. In order to appease his critics, Putin pins the blame for these dire straits solely on the west! NATO’s new military doctrine, with its “attacking capabilities” on Russia’s borders and a “globally encompassing system of missile defense,” is adduced as a fundamental threat. But not even his own people believe Putin. He was contradicted by Economic Development Minister Alexei Ulyukayev, who said: “We have caused this storm ourselves. The crisis had arisen as a result of “what we have not done,” he continued. Yet another sign of how Putin’s power is crumbling.  "
"DONETSK, Ukraine--In their battle to break away from Ukraine, pro-Russian separatists here label Ukrainians from the past as Nazi collaborators, and Ukrainians today as their ideological heirs. It is a message repeated at countless rallies, scrawled on rebel-held checkpoints and beamed across eastern Ukraine by Russian television channels. The relentless campaign reached a fever pitch Friday during the annual celebration of Soviet victory over Nazi Germany. There is one problem with the message: it distorts the truth. Ukrainians died in large numbers fighting Nazi Germany, and while some were collaborators, the number isn't any more significant than collaborators among ethnic Russians, historians say. In modern-day Ukraine, far-right politicians--routinely dragooned by the Russian media to show how Kiev has fallen into neo-Nazi hands--enjoy marginal popular support, according to public-opinion surveys. In Russia, which separatists here hold up as the bulwark against fascism, racism and xenophobia are on the rise, according to a major Russian think tank monitoring extremism. In drawing a direct line from World War II to their current war against Kiev, pro-Russian separatists here are exploiting an emotional wound that is still fresh despite 69 years that have passed since the fall of Berlin. With more than 25 million Soviet citizens killed, nearly all post-Soviet families are just a generation or two removed from a loved one lost in World War II. In literally wrapping their fight with Kiev in antifascist colors--the same orange-and-black ribbons used to commemorate victory over the Nazis--the separatists are seeking broader legitimacy buttressed by a good-against-evil narrative. Pro-Russian forces don't have a monopoly on using powerful negative imagery to demonize the enemy. Kiev has been calling pro-Russian rebels terrorists, a loaded label that has irritated some eastern Ukrainians who don't support the insurgency but who aren't enthusiastic about the interim government in Kiev either. ""When we were told we are all terrorists, we were angry,"" says Marina Belushenko, who lives in the rebel-held Slovyansk, now a target of Kiev's ""antiterrorist operation."" ""Are children here terrorist? Are old ladies who sit on a bench by my house terrorists? We don't want war."" Among the pro-Russian separatists, no one personifies the contradictions of the anti-Nazi narrative better than Pavel Gubarev, the self-proclaimed people's governor of the Donetsk People's Republic. He was detained by Kiev on separatism charges and then released in a prisoner swap with pro-Russian militants, in time for him to appear at Friday's rally in Slovyansk. Wearing military camouflage and flanked by gunmen, Mr. Gubarev cut to the chase. ""Today, fascism is once again raising its beastly face in the guise of the Kiev junta,"" he said referring to Ukraine's central government, which came to power following pro-Western protests earlier this year and is widely viewed here as lacking legitimacy. ""They are bringing their fascist rot, their fascist plague to our land."" Mr. Gubarev is a curious messenger for anti-fascism. When he was younger, he was a member of a Russian neo-Nazi group, which uses a stylized swastika as a logo. Miroslav Rudenko, a longtime friend of Mr. Gubarev's and a fellow Donetsk Republic leader, acknowledged that the people's governor ""used to belong to patriotic movements that are close to skinheads, but it wasn't extreme."" Mr. Rudenko dismissed the whole thing as a youthful fallacy that Mr. Gubarev has since put behind him. Far-right sentiment has been rising in Russia, however, mostly as a reaction to Central Asian migrants who have sought work in major Russian cities. ""The indicators of ethnic intolerance and support for nationalist slogans among wide swaths of the population have risen to an unprecedented level,"" says a 2013 report from Sova, a respected Russian group monitoring extremist trends. ""All of this has created a favorable context for nationalists."" Nationalists also exist in Ukraine and were part of the popular uprising that ousted President Viktor Yanukovych, a Russian ally, in late February. They were rewarded with some ministries in the coalition government that replaced him. But their leaders have close-to-zero popular support. Only 0.7% of respondents said they supported Dmitro Yarosh, the leader of Pravy Sektor, according to an April poll conducted by the Kiev International Institute of Sociology ahead of the May 25 presidential election. His group is routinely held up by the Russian media as emblematic of the neo-Nazi threat, Oleg Tyagnibok, leader of the far-right Svoboda party, polled at 1.4% in the same survey. Ukraine sustained heavy casualties in the 1930s and '40s, first from Stalin's repressions and famine, and then from the war and German occupation. ""Wherever the Germans reached, people collaborated; Russians collaborated in the hundreds of thousands, and there's no reason to think they collaborated any more or less eagerly than Ukrainians did,"" says Timothy Snyder, a historian and an author of ""Bloodlands: Europe between Hitler and Stalin."" Stepan Bandera, a long-dead Ukrainian nationalist leader whose name has become Russian shorthand Ukrainian perfidy in World War II, has a positive image among 30% of Ukrainians--slightly more than those who think positively of Joseph Stalin, according to an April survey by Rating Group, a Ukrainian polling agency. Mr. Bandera did work with the Nazis in pursuit of Ukrainian independence, until he was arrested by them. Mr. Snyder points out that Ukrainians were heavily represented in the Red Army. ""Since so much of the war was fought in Ukraine, first going east and then going back west, Ukrainians were soaked up into the Red Army and died in huge numbers,"" he says. ""More Ukrainians died than British, American and Frenchmen put together, and a lot of Ukrainians were in the forces that liberated Auschwitz, that liberated Berlin.""

"Energy dependence on Russia is meant to be one of the main topics of tomorrow's talks in Warsaw between Prime Minister Donald Tusk and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. The topic of the talks with Angela Merkel was signaled yesterday by Donald Tusk, who after years seems to have noticed the energy relations between Russia and Germany, which are unfavorable from the standpoint of our country and Europe. ""I will be unequivocally formulating our opinions about the political threats stemming from the fact of dependency on Russian gas and money. This does not just apply to Germany, but Germany is quite an outstanding example of this phenomenon in recent years,"" Tusk said yesterday. The prime minister stressed the influence of the EU's energy policy on the security and sovereignty of European countries. ""I will be very openly talking with Chancellor Merkel about how the existing concepts concerning climate policy and natural gas policy could pose a threat to the security and sovereignty of Europe as a whole. In the future we will be unable to put up effective resistance to potential aggressive or expansive steps taken by Russia, if so many European countries remain gas-dependent and continue to move into increasing dependency on Russian gas,"" Tusk said. At the same time the very decisions being made within the EU contribute to our increased dependency on Gazprom. This refers, for instance, to the imposition of ever-greater environmental requirements on EU members, which directly contributes to higher prices of energy generated in Europe. The prime minister stated that dependency on Russian gas contributes to ""Europe's paralysis"" when quick decision-making is required. In the context of the situation in Ukraine, Tusk argued that the role of politicians and the media is not to incite the situation or create a danger in the eyes of society. In this context he offered assurances once again that ""there is no direct threat to Poland."" ""Today there is no threat to Poland's borders, there is no threat to the Poles, but with all certainty we will be intensifying our efforts to bolster Poland's defense, because the geopolitical situation is changing before our very eyes and that threat could be somewhat greater than it was in the past,"" Tusk said. He did not even want to speculate, however, what units are today being mobilized. Defense Minister Tomasz Siemoniak, on the other hand, announced that the deployment of a US Air Force unit would occur by Thursday [13 March]. As part of accelerated exercises, at least twelve F-16 fighter planes, 300 US soldiers, and support crew for the unit are meant to come to our country. ""One week ago we asked the United States to significantly accelerate and enlarge the upcoming Air Force exercises, which had been planned on quite a small scale for March,"" Siemoniak stated. He pointed out that a positive response came back from the Americans already last Wednesday. The defense minister previously announced that the exercises involving the Americans would also involve other airports than Lask, where the Polish F-16s are stationed."
"Europe on Monday postponed sanctions against Moscow ahead of a Ukraine peace summit as US President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel weighed options to end 10 months of bloodshed. Merkel was in Washington as cracks between Europe and the United States seemed to emerge over the White House's mulling of sending arms to Ukraine, an idea flatly rejected by the German leader. Officials from Ukraine, Russia, Germany and France, meanwhile, were hammering out the details for a four-way summit Wednesday on a European-brokered peace plan billed as a last chance to defuse the escalating conflict. Ahead of the possible summit in Minsk, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said the EU would hold off implementing new sanctions to improve the chances of halting fightng that has killed some 5,400 people. ""The latest peace initiative shows that things have begun to move,"" Fabius said in Brussels. EU foreign ministers had been set to formally sign off on adding 19 more people to a sanctions list over Moscow's alleged backing of pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned that a ""number of points"" still needed to be hammered out before the Minsk meeting can take place and wrangling was set to be intense as foreign ministry officials from the four nations met in Berlin. Based on a largely ignored peace deal agreed in September in Minsk, the new plan may extend rebel control over territory they have seized in recent weeks, although Kiev is adamant the demarcation line agreed in September should not be shifted. French President Francois Hollande has said the proposal includes the creation of a 50- 70-kilometre (31-44-mile) demilitarised zone around the current frontline. German foreign ministry spokesman Martin Schaefer said the Minsk talks' goal would be ""a ceasefire to end the bloodshed and thus create space and time for political talks"". The issues on the table include questions about levels of regional autonomy and future elections in rebel-controlled areas, Schaefer said. Fresh fighting over the past 24 hours between government forces and pro-Russian rebels left at least 11 civilians and nine Ukrainian troops dead, Kiev said. Ukraine's military said that 1,500 Russian troops and convoys of military hardware had crossed into the country over the weekend. In a four-way telephone talk on Sunday Putin, Merkel, Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko and Hollande floated the summit as a the next step to finding a ""comprehensive settlement"" to end the conflict, Berlin said. Merkel and Hollande have ramped up their push for peace in recent days, jetting to Kiev first for talks with Poroshenko and then to Moscow to meet with Putin, who the West accuses of masterminding the violence. A September peace deal agreed in Minsk has been largely ignored, with fighting escalating in recent weeks as the rebels push further into government-held territory. Hopes of getting the four leaders together hang in the balance as officials came together in Berlin with German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier cautioning that the leaders' summit was ""not yet sure"". ""Our principal objective is to prepare the elements for a document that is acceptable to Ukraine,"" Olexiy Makeyev, a senior Ukrainian foreign ministry official heading to the meeting, told AFP. Monitors from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), representatives from Kiev and Moscow and the rebels are also set to hold a meeting Tuesday, Ukraine says. In the United States, the White House is facing increasing calls to supply the outmatched Ukrainian army with more weapons to shore up its faltering defences. But Merkel and many European nations believe weapons could not overturn the military mismatch between Ukraine and the might of the Russian army, and would simply escalate the conflict. The Kremlin has warned Europe and the US not to use the threat of arming Kiev to try to push Putin into an agreement over Ukraine. Ukraine and its Western allies accuse Moscow of sending troops and weapons to spearhead the rebellion, but Moscow denies the allegations despite the rebels acquiring heavy weaponry. While the EU had looked set to extend its individual sanctions, there is no agreement to toughen broader economic sanctions and Spain warned an export ban in place now had already cost Europe some $21 billion euros ($23.8 billion). burs-del/cjo/ccr"
"European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini called on everybody, on Friday [24 July], to think of the cost of not reaching a solution to the Cyprus issue, speaking to the press after a meeting with the Cypriot Minister of Foreign Affairs Ioannis Kasoulides [Kasoulidis], in Nicosia. Mogherini’s visit to Cyprus was held as part of her outreach to all the EU member states. The EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice-President of the European Commission and the Cypriot Foreign Minister had a tete-a-tete meeting, at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, followed by official talks, statements to the Press and a working lunch. Issues on the agenda included, inter alia, the developments on the Cyprus problem, the Southern Neighbourhood, EU-Russia relations and Energy Diplomacy. Developments in Syria, Egypt and Libya were also discussed. They also sought ways in which Cyprus could contribute to the EU efforts and involvement in the region. On the Cyprus problem, the High Representative of the EU expressed the Commission’s full support to the efforts for reaching a solution through the UN-lead negotiation process. ""I know the issue of the cost of the reunification is debated. I would invite everybody to think of the cost of non-reunification, economic, human, political, security cost of it,"" Mogherini noted, invited to say whether the EU is ready to support financially the island`s reunification. ""I think that, yes, the EU is strong, it is much stronger than we, ourselves, recognize sometimes"" she said, ""but again, the real costs would be if this process failed. I think that these would be the real cost that no one could bear"". The EU High Representative said she was confident that the leaders of the two communities ""can bring results, especially for the younger generations"", noting that ""what is at stake here is the future of the generations that were growing up in these last 41 years"". She said that a solution would be also an ""investment for the European Union as such"" and a key contribution to the stability and the security of this region. ""So I really hope that this process can lead to a result. I do not say that it is now or never, but I do say that it is either now or very difficult in the future. I will personally do all I can to support this process in order for it to have a positive outcome,"" said Mogherini. The EU foreign policy chief stressed that her visit falls within the efforts to shape a common, strong and consistent foreign and security policy of the European Union and thanked the Cypriot Minister ""for the always strong, wise and truly European approach that Cyprus brings to the table"". As she said, she visited Cyprus ""to meet and discuss the priorities of your country when it comes to the foreign and security European policy. And here obviously, the number one priority is this region, this part of the world, which is the most conflictual and it is also the most relevant for the EU’s external action"". On the Iranian nuclear programme agreement, the High Representative noted that it was obviously a matter of security for Cyprus and the EU, whereas on the Syrian crisis she pointed out that it is lasting too long, with security and humanitarian consequences, with huge flow of refugees that create ""other issues on our European table"". The Palestinian issue ""is another area where our cooperation is hopefully bringing some fruits and results,"" she added, thanking Cyprus for its contribution to reviving the EU role in opening new perspective for the peace process. Welcoming the High Representative, the Cypriot Minister said that they had an in depth discussion on a whole range of issues that affect the foreign policy agenda of both Cyprus and the EU. ""Cyprus is a strong advocate for a robust and coherent EU common foreign and security policy. We are also committed to the further strengthening of the European External Action Service,"" he said. Kasoulides added that they exchanged views on developments in the EU’s Southern Neighbourhood. ""Cyprus is the EU’s border in this volatile area and we shared ideas on how Cyprus and the EU can contribute to the promotion of regional stability and security,"" he noted. The Cypriot Minister congratulated the High Representative for the EU’s for her own personal role in reaching the historic agreement on Iran’s nuclear programme and said that ""we expect that Iran will assume a constructive and responsible regional role in order to allay the concerns of other friendly nations in our neighbourhood"". He said that they also discussed the EU-Russia relations as well as the situation in Ukraine. ""I underlined that engagement is better than confrontation and that the EU should develop a strategic vision of its relations with Russia,"" he noted."
"Excerpt from report by Moldovan Dniester region news agency website Novosti Pridnestrovya Tiraspol, 17 April: The president of [Moldova's breakaway] Dniester region, Yevgeniy Shevchuk, has held consultations with representatives of the Dniester expert group in charge of economic issues. The consequences of the blocking of the Dniester economy were discussed. [Passage omitted: the introduction by Ukraine of special rules for cargoes imported by Dniester companies and for excisable goods was on the agenda.] The participants in the meeting noted that the unilateral actions taken by the Ukrainian partners were an additional factor aggravating the situation for Dniester companies and leading to significant losses for the Dniester budget. First deputy chairman of the Dniester state customs committee Svetlana Klimenkova reported: ""In the first quarter of 2015 (compared with the same period 2014) we have registered a 23-per-cent fall in the trade turnover which is 1.7bn roubles [1 dollar equals 11.1 Dniester roubles]. Hence the amount of customs taxes reduced by 49 per cent. In the first quarter of 2014 the budget received the amount of 232m roubles in customs taxes, in the first three months of 2015 only 121m roubles. So, the state treasury's losses exceeded 100m roubles. The customs fees from the foreign trade activities with Ukrainian companies plunged by over 510m roubles"". At the meeting with representatives of the governing bodies and members of the expert groups, it was mentioned that amid regional economic turbulence and from the point of customs support of foreign economic activity, a repressive customs regime is in force as regards Dniester companies, which runs counter to the negotiations process agreements and international norms. In the framework of the meeting, representatives of ministries asked the head of state to initiate a discussion of the situation in the Dniester region at the political level given the unilateral actions of a participant in the five plus two talks [Ukraine has a status of a guarantor and mediator within this format]. Yevgeniy Shevchuk asked the Dniester foreign ministry to analyze whether politically motivated goals are behind the actions of the neighbouring countries and the EUBAM [EU border mission] towards Dniester companies. Yevgeniy Shevchuk stressed that along with operation of the five plus two format and restoration of fragile confidence with Moldova, elements of mutual understanding and compromises on more complicated problems are emerging. However, actions of a participant in the talks format, namely the Ukrainian partners, to a substantial extent facilitated losses to the Dniester budget, hence caused the inability of paying in full wages in the public sector and pensions to the citizens of the Dniester region, Ukraine, Russia and Moldova dwelling on Dniester territory. The head of state with regret stated that the worsening of the socioeconomic situation touched upon some 80,000 Ukrainian citizens living in the Dniester region. In fact, such restrictions enable expansion of poverty across the entire Dniester population, he added. ""We feel some external attempts to sow inter-ethnic discord in the Dniester region. I am sure that these attempts are futile. To all foreign challenges we are ready to respond by consolidation and professional actions and decisions,"" Shevchuk said. At the end of the meeting, the president gave several orders to respective agencies. Source: Novosti Pridnestrovya website, Tiraspol, in Russian 1537gmt 17 Apr 15"
"Excerpt from report by private Ukrainian news agency UNIAN Kyiv, 31 January: Investigative bodies are considering two versions in the case of the abduction of one of the Euro-Maydan [motorist protest] activists, Dmytro Bulatov, in particular a kidnapping for ransom and a staged abduction aimed at provocation that could cause negative attitudes in society, a deputy head of the main investigative directorate of the Interior Ministry, Oleh Tatarov, has told a briefing in Kyiv.

"Frankfurt 08/28/2014 08:11 (AFP) -- Unemployment in Germany stagnated in August, as clouds continue to build over Europe's biggest economy, official data showed on Thursday [28 August]. The unemployment rate stood at 6.7 percent in seasonally adjusted terms in August, unchanged from July, while the number of people registered as unemployed edged up by 2,000, the Federal Labour Office said in a statement. That took analysts by surprise. They had projected a decline of around 5,000. ""The German economy shrank by 0.2 percent in the second quarter. Weak exports and investment could not be offset by stable consumption, which means that the continual growth seen in the preceding four quarters was halted,"" the labour office said in a statement. ""External economic uncertainty is having an increasing effect, notably the conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine,"" the office continued. ""The signs for the third quarter are also very subdued. Developments on the labour market, however, are still moderately positive,"" it said. In raw or unadjusted terms, the German jobless total rose by 30,472 to 2.902 million and the unadjusted jobless rate edged up to 6.7 percent from 6.6 percent, the office calculated.  "
"Geneva 03/19/2014 12:53 (AFP) - Switzerland has decided to freeze talks on a trade deal with Russia as a result of the Crimea crisis, its economy minister said on Wednesday [19 March]. Johann Schneider-Ammann said the talks with Moscow and its ex-Soviet customs union partners Belarus and Kazakhstan had been put on hold ""in such a situation of uncertainty."" ""The reason is the difficult situation over Crimea ... We cannot of course pretend that nothing has happened,"" he told Swiss public radio station SRF. ""Free-trade deals are important. The Russian market is important, and the customs union's market is important, but not at any price,"" he said. ""We have therefore decided to put the talks on hold, in order to be able to negotiate in safer circumstances in due course,"" he added. The decision marks Switzerland's first formal diplomatic move against Russia since the Kremlin's takeover of Crimea, which Sunday voted to split from Ukraine and join Russia, in a referendum condemned by the West. Switzerland is not a member of the European Union, which has decided to slap sanctions on Russia. Schneider-Ammann said that the Swiss government was set to discuss the issue of sanctions over the coming weeks. Switzerland was at the forefront of a drive to freeze funds linked to Ukrainian ex-leader Viktor Yanukovych and his inner circle. Russia-backed Yanukovych was ousted as president in February after months of street protests, and Moscow intervened in Crimea, a mainly Russian-speaking region. Switzerland currently chairs the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and in that capacity had on Tuesday dubbed Russia's takeover of Crimea a fundamental breach of Moscow's commitments under international law.  "
"German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier wants the country to take a more active approach to foreign policy. He spoke to SPIEGEL about the situation in Ukraine, the Merkel Doctrine and Germany's changing global role. SPIEGEL: Mr. Steinmeier, you played a part in negotiating the political agreement between Ukraine's government and its opposition. What was at stake? Steinmeier: We sat and negotiated for over 20 hours. When we arrived, black smoke was already rising above Independence Square, and you could hear gunshots. We were constantly hearing about the rising death toll. Everybody knew that our negotiations were the last chance for a political solution. I think it made people more prepared to make the necessary compromises. SPIEGEL: Did Russia try to thwart your efforts? Steinmeier: Russia backed our roadmap. President Putin sent an emissary to Kiev on Thursday -- he negotiated during night and was very constructive. The Russian delegate helped build bridges while putting together the text. It was also in Russia's interest to end the bloodshed. SPIEGEL: It had seemed, previously, that Vladimir Putin was encouraging the conflict. Steinmeier: A week ago I had a long conversation with Putin about the situation in Kiev. He agreed with me, that the worst thing that could happen to Ukraine was for the tug of war between the East and the West for the country to continue for the next ten years. Mrs. Merkel has also kept in touch. Anarchy and civil war right next door -- that is definitely not in Russia's interest. And as a ""failed state,"" Ukraine would topple towards the East -- and become a burden for Russia. SPIEGEL: Former Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, a Social Democrat like yourself, has said the Europeans are ill-suited to mediate in Ukraine because they have interests of their own. What made you, along with your colleagues from France and Poland, decide to travel to Kiev? Steinmeier: The decision came together in the last few days during talks with Laurent Fabius and Radek Sikorski. It was a trip into the unknown. We were aware of the danger because an agreement seemed unlikely, but we still believed that we had a responsibility to at least try to figure out a way from the outside to keep the situation from escalating. That said, we had no idea that the body count would continue to rise on the day of our arrival. SPIEGEL: In hindsight, was it wrong that the EU made Ukraine choose between Russia and EU with the Association Agreement? Don't European leaders carry some responsibility for the escalation of tensions? Steinmeier: It's spilled milk. But we shouldn't forget that it was Ukraine that wanted the Association Agreement with the European Union. SPIEGEL: Opposition leaders like Vitali Klitschko called for sanctions early on. The United States were in favor of them as well. Should Europe have listened? Steinmeier: Only pushing for sanctions is not good policy. Sanctions need to be a means to an end. They cannot be an end in themselves. Ultimately, I think we used this tool responsibly. SPIEGEL: Did Russia suddenly realize it was in its best interest to cooperate with the West? Steinmeier: Russia is an important partner but not a simple one. We've reached solutions with Russia about Syria's chemical weapons, the Iran dossier, and now Ukraine. Elsewhere that hasn't been the case. In those latter circumstances, we continue talking and searching for common ground. SPIEGEL: So you want to continue the Russia policies that put you in conflict with the Chancellery during your first term as foreign minister from 2005 to 2009? Steinmeier: What's the alternative? Sitting insulted in the corner and refusing to talk? In foreign policy, if we make a habit of being uncommunicative with countries that don't share our politics, we won't get anywhere in resolving many of the world's crises. SPIEGEL: It's not about whether we should be talking to the Russians, but how. Back then, you argued for the soft-spoken approach -- without much success. Steinmeier: History judges the success of a foreign policy. And it's yet to be proven that shouting your arguments through a megaphone will work in your favor. Russia is a European country and I want it to stay that way. There are justifiable criticisms of Russia -- we have significantly different ideas about the rule of law and civil liberties. In spite of that, we want to try to enact positive change and work more closely in the areas where we agree. I've called this the ""positive agenda."" SPIEGEL: During your first term, you also initiated discussions with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Have the ensuing developments in Syria proven you wrong? Today, the idea that Assad could become a partner of the West seems unrealistic. Steinmeier: You think? Back then I found the division of the world into black and white along the Axis of Evil to be much more unrealistic. I pushed for talks with Assad at a time when he was not yet as ideologically obstinate. I thought it was possible that him having a connection to the West could have allowed us to have greater influence over the developments in the country. I'm less certain than you are that that was incorrect. SPIEGEL: So if people had listened to you, it wouldn't have come to this? Steinmeier: Syria is teaching us that we need to more closely analyze political conflicts before we make decisions. SPIEGEL: And what will be the consequences? Steinmeier: On the short- and even middle-term, I don't see a possible political solution in Syria. We will already have achieved a lot if we can put a stop to violent confrontations over local cease-fires and humanitarian access. SPIEGEL: For someone who wants an active foreign policy, that sounds very modest. Steinmeier: An active foreign policy doesn't mean having an immediate solution prepared for every conflict. International conflicts all too frequently take two weeks to start and two decades to be solved. SPIEGEL: Then please explain what an active foreign policy might look like. Steinmeier: In Germany we've gotten very used to commenting on the behavior of others. We often know exactly what the English, French and Americans are doing wrong. But we are not willing to do more ourselves. I'd like to change that: We shouldn't wait until the kid is already lying at the bottom of the well. SPIEGEL: That didn't always bother you. When the UN Security Council gave the green light for an intervention in Libya three years ago, Germany abstained. You agreed with that decision. Steinmeier: We need to keep those two things separate. The vote in the Security Council was one thing, the German decision not to contribute militarily was another. I thought it was the right thing for Germany not to take part in the intervention, and I still do. And I'm not very impressed by what those who dropped bombs on Libya have left behind. SPIEGEL: And the vote in the Security Council? Steinmeier: We could argue about that, but that's water under the bridge. I want to make the case that we should exert influence on conflicts earlier and more decisively, and get involved wherever we may have influence. The situation in Kiev shows that it works. SPIEGEL: That sounds as if you're mostly talking about diplomacy. When it comes to military intervention, you yourself have said that a culture of restraint cannot become a culture of disengagement. Has that too frequently been the case in the past? Steinmeier: It's not just about diplomacy or military intervention. It's about foreign policy. And it's pretty absurd that the quality of a foreign policy is measured by the number of foreign interventions and deployed soldiers it involves. Military intervention must remain a last resort. That will not change. SPIEGEL: Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen says Germany can't look away when murder and rape have become commonplace. Do you share her opinion? Steinmeier: At the end of the nineties, I was part of our decision to take part in the NATO airstrikes against Serbia. We said no to the war in Iraq and yes to the deployment in Afghanistan. You have to look at those decisions together. Those were very difficult choices that were made with a lot of responsibility. That will continue to be the case in the future. SPIEGEL: Then why do we need this new foreign policy? Steinmeier: The world has changed and we need to do a few things differently. People have noticed that foreign policy's reputation has begun to improve again. But that's not enough. In the Foreign Ministry, I have introduced a policy of self-review in order to kick off a public debate about the terms and perspectives of German foreign policy. We want to ask whether German foreign policy has emphasized the right things in recent years. SPIEGEL: Do you think the chancellor also believes it is time to take a critical look back at the past four years? Steinmeier: To my knowledge, the chancellor has nothing against Germany being more visible in the world and concentrating on its core foreign policy challenges. SPIEGEL: Angela Merkel has been extremely restrained when it came to military deployments. The Merkel Doctrine favors arms deliveries to conflict areas so that regional players can determine their own outcome. Steinmeier: Germany's arms export policy will remain restrictive. That is a core conviction of the Social Democrats. But we want to go further, namely, we want to make arms exports more transparent. That will change the nature of such deals in the mid-term. In the future, tank deliveries to Saudi Arabia won't be so simple. SPIEGEL: We've spoken about difficult partners, and on Thursday you'll be visiting one. What will you tell US Secretary of State John Kerry about the mood in German parliament? Steinmeier: The United States look at the balance between freedom and security differently than the Europeans, especially the Germans. It has a lot to do with history. The divide is a deep one and we cannot underestimate the work that lies ahead of us. I doubt, by the way, that a ""no-spy agreement"" will get us very far. SPIEGEL: The Americans continue to spy on us unapologetically and your reaction is: Let's talk about it? Steinmeier: I don't believe the Americans will continue to act as they have. Washington has hopefully understood that the way it treats its partners can have a political price. In other areas, the European and American concept of privacy is still very different. I'd like to talk about this with Secretary of State Kerry. SPIEGEL: Mr. Steinmeier, thank you for this interview.

"He is being kept out of the door yet he is more of a leading player than ever. Possibly only to be reprimanded, albeit in his absence, with warnings that sound like threats, with invitations to get back in line, and with extremely tough criticism, but he is still a leading player all the same. Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has attracted the West's criticism for annexing Crimea and for violating Ukraine's sovereignty, is the man whom everyone is talking about at the Brussels summit, which is no longer a G8 but once again a G7 precisely because Putin has been thrown out. And US President Barack Obama, fresh from a visit to Poland where he dusted off a form of rhetoric that sounds out of place coming from him regarding the East European countries' key role in NATO's strategy, is hogging the role of the Great Absentee's [source capitalization] foremost accuser. Having reminded Putin, speaking in Warsaw the day before, that the time has come to choose between responsibility and the ""murky tactics that would return us to the worst moments of the 20th century,"" speaking in Brussels yesterday Obama threatened the arrival of tougher sanctions if Moscow ""continues to pursue its strategy based on weakening Ukraine."" We will draw our conclusions a few weeks from now if we see no change, the US President clarified. Obama was speaking as the leader of a united alignment, yet he is aware that his European allies -- verbally behind him in responding to the illegalities committed by Putin in Ukraine -- have differing degrees of conviction and of reliability in that sense. Germany gives him cause for concern on account of the mass of economic interests it shares with Russia; France on account of its refusal to give up (or at least to suspend) its huge military deal with Moscow involving the supply of Mistral ships and including a training course for the Russian sailors taking delivery of them; and the Europeans in general on account of their dependence on Siberia for their gas and oil. That is why, in his talks with the G7 leaders, Obama has been insistent in his demand that there be no letup in the pressure being brought to bear on the Kremlin leader: He knows that it is more difficult for the Europeans than for him to put on a show of inflexible consistency. And in the meantime, the stone guest in Brussels has arrived in Paris. [passage omitted]"
"KATHMANDU:  Nepal is likely to abstain from voting on Thursday when the UN General Assembly is expected to vote on a draft resolution on Ukraine, underscoring that the referendum that led to Crimea's annexation by Russia ""has no validity."" The draft resolution, circulated Monday to the 193 assembly members, urges all parties to pursue a peaceful resolution of the situation in Ukraine, ""refrain from unilateral actions and inflammatory rhetoric that may increase tensions, and to engage fully with international mediation efforts."" As diplomatic pressure from the west mounts on Nepal to vote in favour of Ukraine's proposal, the government has decided to skip the voting, saying that it will look into its national interest first before making a decision on the vote. Nepal 's two giant neighbours India and China--whose vote and position count in UN General Assembly--are in different boats on the issue. India has made its position clear that it believes Russia has ""legitimate interests"" in Ukraine--a position that is opposed to the stand of the west on the latest crisis. China, on the other hand, has been maintaining that Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity must be respected, calling for peaceful negotiation to resolve the dispute.  On Wednesday, ambassadors of Germany, France, Norway, Denmark, Switzerland, UK and Finland held a meeting with Officiating Foreign Secretary Shanker Das Bairagi and solicited Nepal 's position on Ukraine's crisis asking him to vote in favour of the resolution. But conveying Nepal ’s position on the issue, Bairagi hinted the visiting diplomats that the government is still gauzing the situation and closely following developments in New York and has not decided about the voting yet. A diplomatic source told the Post that the European diplomats “felt very distressed over the Nepal government’s position on Ukraine and concluded that Nepal is unlikely to vote in Ukraine’s favour.” Not just Nepal , but many other nations are going to skip the voting, said Foreign Minister Mahendra Bahadur Pandey. “It is really difficult and pressing issue for us which has put us in diplomatic quandary. We are assessing the situation there and will take a final call by Thursday evening,” he said.  In his statement delivered to parliament on Wednesday, Pandey said: “It has been the principled position of the Government of Nepal that sovereignty, territorial integrity, political independence and non-interference in the internal affairs of any country must be fully respected and strictly adhered to in seeking solutions to all disputes.” The government also urged all parties concerned to work towards the peaceful resolution of the crisis in Ukraine in accordance with the principles and purposes of the UN Charter as well as in compliance with international law, Pandey said in the House. “ Nepal calls on the international community to support the ongoing efforts of the UN Secretary General in ending the crisis peacefully and establishing the peace in the region,” said the statement."
"KIEV (Reuters) - Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko is likely to order government forces to start pullng back heavy weapons in the country's east on Thursday under a Feb. 12 peace deal, a military source said. ""We expect the statement by the president later today,"" the source said. Pro-Russian separatists say they have started to pull back heavy weapons under the agreement. Kiev has said its forces will start pulling back their big guns only when the shooting stops, and fighting has eased considerably in the past few days.

"KIEV (Reuters) - Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, in a move to head off discontent before an election, signed a law on Tuesday that will allow ousted leader Viktor Yanukovich to be tried by court in his absence for crimes carried out while he was in power. Poroshenko and his pro-Western government, who are seeking a strong mandate in a parliamentary election on Sunday, face criticism from many for not being tough enough in bringing to justice Yanukovich who fled ""Euromaidan"" street protests last February with his family and cronies. Kiev authorities accuse Yanukovich, who is in Russia, of involvement in the deaths of protesters who were shot dead by police at the time, large-scale theft of state property and funds, and an attempt to overthrow the new leadership. Up to now, Ukrainian law has not allowed for the prosecution of people abroad to be tried in their absence for crimes committed in Ukraine. But Poroshenko, who was elected in May and who hopes for a strong pro-Europe coalition of support from Sunday's election, said on his website that he had inked amendments to the criminal code which would allow for those ""who have robbed our people"" and were hiding abroad to be tried by a court in their absence. The change to the law foresaw seizure of property and assets of those found guilty in their absence of crimes against the Ukrainian people, he said. Yanukovich, who was followed by senior ministers and aides when he fled to Russia, left property in the country including a huge estate outside Kiev and at least one villa on the Black Sea. The signing of the law takes place as the pro-Western authorities try to rid the state bureaucracy of sympathizers of Yanukovich and corrupt officials deemed to have taken kick-backs during his rule. The overthrow of the Moscow-backed Yanukovich triggered the annexation of Crimea by Russia and pro-Russian separatist rebellions in the east which have caused the biggest crisis in relations between Russia and the West since the Cold War. A pro-European majority is expected to dominate in parliament after the election, with Russian influence greatly diminished.

"KIEV, March 9 (Reuters) - An armed pro-Russian force wearing military uniforms bearing no designated markings sealed off another military airport in Ukraine's Crimea on Sunday, a defence ministry spokesman on the peninsula said. The 80 or so-strong group, who were supporting 50 civilians, blocked off the entrance to the airport near the village of Saki and established machine-gun posts along the landing strip, the spokesman, Vladislav Seleznyov, told Reuters by telephone. The civilian group, who were wielding sticks and clubs, sought to break into the airport's control terminal, he said. Russian forces have taken control of strategic points in Crimea, including Belbek military airport and the main civilian airport in Simferopol, without bloodshed following the overthrow of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich on Feb. 21 after a three-month revolt against his rule. There have been several standoffs with Ukrainian forces at military installations but the Ukrainians have not put up armed resistance.

"KIEV, Ukraine -- After five months of intensifying combat that threatened to rip Ukraine apart and to reignite the Cold War, the Ukrainian government and separatist forces signed a cease-fire agreement on Friday that analysts considered highly tenuous in a country that remains a tinderbox. Previous attempts to stop the fighting have failed. But the prime difference this time was that the main thrust of the plan was not just endorsed, but laid out, by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, whom Western leaders accuse of stoking unrest to prevent Ukraine from slipping out of Russia's orbit. Whether a cease-fire persists will probably be determined by negotiations over the political future of the southeastern region, where rebel separatists have been fighting the government since April. The cease-fire was agreed to after a two-week rebel counteroffensive backed by Russian troops, armor and artillery that threatened to roll back most of the gains the Ukrainian military had made. Russia has not acknowledged the presence of any of its military units on Ukrainian soil, and there was no mention of their removal as part of the agreement. From the moment the crisis erupted in November -- when Ukraine's president at the time, Viktor F. Yanukovych, rejected a trade agreement with the European Union in favor of a deal with Russia -- Kiev and the West have accused Moscow of destabilizing the country, first with a stealth invasion and annexation of Crimea and then by inspiring and covertly arming the rebels in southeastern Ukraine. The conflict ignited the most serious East-West confrontation since the end of the Cold War, with Europe and the United States looking largely impotent as Moscow upset the postwar order by altering borders by force. The West has imposed some economic sanctions, and it is threatening more, but the Kremlin has dismissed their impact and made it clear that it no longer feels itself beholden to Western nations or institutions. The agreement reached Friday laid out the first tentative steps toward both an immediate cessation of hostilities and the promise of greater political freedom in the future. Artillery exchanges tapered off after it was put in effect at 6 p.m., and quiet prevailed through the initial hours. President Obama, speaking at a news conference at the end of a NATO summit meeting in Wales, said he was ''hopeful but, based on past experience, also skeptical'' about the strength of any cease-fire. Dmitri S. Peskov, Mr. Putin's spokesman, issued a statement lauding the agreement and expressing hope that it would be observed in full. The 14-point peace plan includes some references to the cease-fire itself, some practical steps toward returning government control to the southeast Donbass region and some nods toward future political changes, according to a summary published by the Ukrainian national information agency. The agreement resembles, almost verbatim, a proposal for a truce issued by President Petro O. Poroshenko in June. It includes amnesty for those who disarm and who did not commit serious crimes, and the exchange of all prisoners. Militias will be disbanded, and a 10-kilometer buffer zone -- about six miles -- will be established along the Russian-Ukrainian border. The area will be subject to joint patrols. The separatists have agreed to leave the administrative buildings they control and to allow broadcasts from Ukraine to resume on local television. It was unclear how ''disarmament'' would be defined, and it emerged as a potential stumbling block. The separatists have demanded that Ukrainian forces withdraw completely from the area, a condition that Kiev considers a nonstarter. The militias will also be unlikely to abandon their weapons. For the future, the agreement says power will be decentralized and the Russian language protected. An early, failed attempt by more extreme members of the Ukrainian Parliament to ban Russian as an official language was one element that spawned the uprising. The agreement says the executive in control of each region, the equivalent of a governor, will be appointed after consultations with each region. It also promises early elections and a job-creation program. The negotiators, meeting in Minsk, Belarus, said they would reconvene on Monday to discuss the mechanics to carry out the agreement. Mr. Poroshenko lauded the agreement in a statement posted on the presidential website, paying tribute in his announcement to the fact that Mr. Putin called for a cease-fire with a seven-point plan released Wednesday. Both men said before Friday that they expected an agreement. A spectrum of politicians, civil society activists, diplomats and other analysts welcomed the proposal but expressed serious doubts that it could hold given the wide rift between Kiev and the restive eastern regions. ''I am pleased; it is impossible to solve this conflict by military means,'' said Georgiy Kasyanov, a civil society activist and historian who supported the antigovernment protests that erupted in central Kiev last November and eventually led to the overthrow of the government and the conflict. ''People are tired and suffer from psychological depression; we have all been living in a state of shock since November.'' But he, like many, recognized the hurdles ahead. The majority of Ukrainians want peace, he said, but some will be angry about any compromise with the separatist fighters the government has condemned as terrorists for months. In addition, neither side exerts perfect control over the range of fighters in the Donbass region. It will be hard to rein them all in, and any spark could easily reignite the fighting. The goals of the separatists have never been clear, nor whether they agree even among themselves. ''We are planning to continue the course toward secession,'' said Igor Plotnitskiy, the prime minister of the self-declared Luhansk People's Republic, according to the RIA Novosti news service. ''The cease-fire is a necessary measure. There is a lot of work ahead of us.'' The other side laid down a hard line, too. Prime Minister Arseniy P. Yatsenyuk said on Twitter that transforming the cease-fire into a lasting peace would require three things: a long-term cease-fire, the withdrawal of the Russian Army and a wall along the border. Yuriy Syrotyuk, a member of Parliament from the right-wing Svoboda party, said he expected no results. ''This is a truce; it is not peace,'' Mr. Syrotyuk said in an interview. ''There will be no result because Ukraine will not give up Donetsk and Luhansk and Russia will not stop.'' In response to an email query, Clifford Kupchan, a director at the Eurasia Group, a Washington consulting firm, and a former State Department official, wrote, ''I fear it won't hold.'' The main stumbling block, he said, is that Russia seeks federalization, including the right for each region to conduct its own foreign policy, whereas Mr. Poroshenko has offered only decentralization and would face a political backlash if he went any further. Many analysts said the probable outcome would be a frozen conflict, much like those Russia created in Georgia and Moldova to keep them destabilized. At the negotiations in Minsk, Ukraine was represented by a former president, Leonid Kuchma, and the rebels by Aleksandr Zakharchenko, the prime minister and military commander of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic. Russia's envoy was its ambassador to Kiev, Mikhail Zurabov, and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, acting for Europe, was represented by Heidi Tagliavini. Ukrainian forces suffered heavy setbacks in the past two weeks, with the separatists breaking out of their isolation in the cities of Donetsk and Luhansk and opening a third front along the strategic southern coast around Mariupol. The Russian-backed rebels, who seized control of the coastal town of Novoazovsk last week, had advanced about halfway from Novoazovsk to Mariupol in fighting that continued through Friday morning. Officials interpreted the opening of a new, southern front as an attempt by Moscow to convince Mr. Poroshenko that he had to reach terms at the negotiating table because he could not win on the battlefield."
"KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - Ukraine's jailing of former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko was a politically motivated violation of her rights, Europe's human rights court ruled on Tuesday, dealing a harsh blow to President Viktor Yanukovych who has insisted that the case against his top opponent was not political. The prosecution of Tymoshenko, the country's most vocal opposition leader, has strained the former Soviet state's ties with the European Union and the United States. Tuesday's ruling put fresh pressure of Yanukovych to ensure Tymoshenko's release if he wants to sign a key cooperation agreement with Brussels later this year. There was no immediate comment from the government, other than a promise to closely analyze the ruling. Tymoshenko, a heroine of Ukraine's 2004 pro-democracy Orange Revolution who was instantly recognizable her blond braid wrapped around her head like a crown, was sentenced to seven years in prison in October 2011 after being convicted of exceeding her powers as premier while negotiating a gas contract with Russia. The West has condemned Tymoshenko's jailing and other legal cases against her as politically motivated and insisted on her release. Tymoshenko has accused Yanukovych of masterminding the legal campaign against her to keep her out politics. She insists her rights were violated when she was first jailed in August 2011 during her trial on charges of contempt of court. The Strasbourg-based court agreed unanimously that her jailing was ""for other reasons"" than those permissible by law. In Kiev, Tymoshenko's defense team called on Yanukovych to honor the ruling and free her from jail soon. Her daughter Eugenia said that the ruling will be like the ""first ray of sunlight"" for her mother who is undergoing treatment for a spinal condition in a hospital ward where windows are shut and draped. ""The European court has recognized my mom as a political prisoner and now the authorities in Ukraine will no longer be able to deny this and deny the fact that she must be freed in the coming days or weeks,"" a triumphant Eugenia Tymoshenko told reporters. ""Today is the first step toward her complete political rehabilitation and she will be freed soon. Soon she will be completely cleared of all the false and absurd accusations."" The Ukrainian government's response to the ruling was muted. In Strasbourg, Ukraine's Permanent Representative to the Council of Europe, Mykola Tochytskyi, stormed out of the courthouse after the ruling was read out. In Kiev, the Foreign Ministry said it is not ready to comment until It scrutinizes the ruling, while a government representative with the Court told the Interfax news agency that the government may appeal. Both sides have three months to do so. Yanukovych has left Kiev on a short vacation and his spokeswoman could not be reached for comment on the prospects of the president releasing Tymoshenko. In the past Yanukovych has insisted that the Tymoshenko case is not political, that Ukrainian courts are independent and that he cannot interfere in the legal proceedings. He has also resisted calls to pardon Tymoshenko on humanitarian grounds. Yanukovych has said that he will consider pardoning her after all the other legal proceedings against her are over. Tymoshenko has been charged with embezzlement, tax evasion and organizing the murder of a politician and businessman 17 years ago -- charges she denies. The European court ruling leaves Kieve to decide how to implement it. Last summer the European Court of Human Rights passed a similar ruling regarding a top Tymoshenko ally, former Interior Minister Yuri Lutsenko, whose jailing was also condemned as politically motivated by the West. The court ruled that the initial arrest of Lutsenko, who was then sentenced to four years in prison on charges of abuse of office and embezzlement, was also unlawful. While the Ukrainian government paid Lutsenko (EURO)15,000 in compensation, as per the court ruling, he was released only in April after Yanukovych pardoned him on humanitarian grounds, not based on the Strasbourg ruling. Kiev-based political analyst Volodymyr Fesenko said that Tuesday's ruling was not legally binding for Kiev, because it concerns the conditions of Tymoshenko's two-month-long arrest before her conviction and sentencing. Today, Tymoshenko is no longer under arrest and is serving out her seven-year-sentence, which she is also appealing with the European Court of Human Rights. It is unclear when a decision on that is expected. ""He will not free her now,"" Fesenko said of Yanukovych, adding that Ukraine may offer Tymoshenko monetary compensation but will contest the finding of political motives behind her arrest. ""The legal marathon will continue."" Olga Shumylo-Tapiola, a Ukraine scholar at Carnegie Europe, also said that the decision, although unpleasant for the Ukrainian government, was not mandatory. ""The court confirmed that the way she was detained was politically motivated,"" Shumylo-Tapiola said, adding that it is now up to Kiev to ponder the next move. ""They're not ready to release her."" Vadim Karasyov, a political expert with ties to the government, speculated that Tymoshenko will not be released now, but as a face-saving the government may allow for her to be transported to Germany for treatment before the landmark Ukraine-EU summit later this year. That way, Tymoshenko will still be out of the Ukrainian political scene, something Yanukovych wants, and Brussels may agree to sign the association deal with Kiev. In Kiev, Tymoshenko's political allies and members of her party rushed to congratulate her and call on the government to ensure her release, but there was little jubilation on the streets of the Ukrainian capital with Ukrainians largely disillusioned with politics. In a tent camp set up in the center of the Ukrainian capital outside the courthouse where Tymoshenko was convicted, there were only a handful of her supporters, who reacted with joy, but said they did not believe the government would release her. ""He (Yanukovych) has always been afraid of her,"" said Oleksiy Karaulny, 63, a retired carpenter in Kiev, one of the activists at the tent camp. ""Of course we are happy. And it's not only me who his happy, it's all the 12 million (people) who voted for her are also happy. They know that truth will come, that justice will prevail."" ------ Hinnant reported from Strasbourg, France. ------ Lori Hinnant can be reached at https://twitter.com/lhinnant"
"KIEV, Ukraine (AP) — Two parties in Ukraine's governing coalition say that they won't abandon the grouping amid intense disputes over a proposal to give more power to Ukraine's regions, including the rebel-held east. However, the two parties' opposition to the measure appears firm and President Petro Poroshenko faces a steep battle to push it through. Oleg Berezyuk, head of the Samopomich faction, said Wednesday it will ""remain in the coalition in the role of opposition within the parliamentary majority."" A member of Poroshenko's faction, Igor Kononeko, said the faction of former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko would also remain in the coalition, the Interfax news agency reported. Three national guard members died after a grenade was thrown from a crowd of protesters outside parliament on Monday as lawmakers gave preliminary approval to the measure."
"KISHINEV WILL ASK NATO TO DEPLOY ITS CONTINGENT IN MOLDOVA TO PROTECT IT FROM RUSSIA Moldova will invite NATO to station its contingent in this country. Moldovan ex-minister of security Anatol Plugaru said that official Kishinev meant to do away with sovereignty and ask the Alliance to dispatch a contingent to Moldova to protect it from Russia. ""We hope that NATO will be here come autumn... before the parliamentary election in Moldova,"" said Plugaru. National Socialist Party leader Victor Stepanyuk and lawmaker Grigori Petrenko confirmed that the Moldovan leadership was discussing this development with countries of the West. Official Kishinev released a statement the other day that it was upset by Russia's ""potential military actions in the Crimea."" Dmitry Soin, member of the Supreme Soviet of the Trans-Dniester region, said that the regional army and the Russian contingent stationed there were put to a higher state of readiness. Yevgeny Shevchuk, President of the self-proclaimed Trans-Dniester Moldovan Republic, ordered stiffer security measures along the borders with Moldova and Ukraine. Tiraspol distrusted the new Ukrainian authorities.. and doubly so after the decision of the Russian Federation Council to grant President Putin the power to send the military to Ukraine. President of Romania Traian Basescu said, ""As things stand, the situation in Ukraine poses no direct or immediate dangers to security of the Romanian state or its sovereignty. And yet, Romania warns that appearance of a new latent conflict in the Crimea following Nagorno-Karabakh, Abkhazia, Ossetia, and Trans-Dniester region will compromise regional stability. It might escalate tension and eventually trigger an armed conflict."" According to Basescu, Romania considered the presence of Russian troops in Ukraine without Ukraine's consent ""aggression"". He also discouraged the Russian president from ""trying to play games in Moldova."" Plugaru said that the events in Ukraine might encourage the Moldovan authorities to actively seek protection from Russia. ""Kishinev will make an appeal to NATO. To accomplish that, however, state neutrality will have to be abandoned but the ruling alliance does have the necessary votes in the parliament."" The former minister said, ""Russia may make it unnecessary. All it has to do is remove Shevchuk and engineer a merger of Moldova and the Trans-Dniester region in a federation or confederation. Moldova's territorial integrity will be restored then and Moldova will become Russia's faithful ally... As for the Ukrainians and Russians, I reckon that they will sort it out without a war. Millions Ukrainians live and work in Russia... and millions Russians live in Ukraine."" WPS'2014"

"MANNHEIM, Germany--German economic expectations fell sharply in March as a result of the continued uncertainty regarding Russia and Ukraine, a key sentiment indicator showed Tuesday. The ZEW sentiment survey showed the indicator for economic expectations fell further than expected to 46.6 from 55.7 in February, marking its lowest level since August and the third decline in as many months. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had forecast the figure would be 52.0. ""The Crimea Crisis is weighing on experts' economic expectations for Germany,"" ZEW President Clemens Fuest said in a news release. On Monday, the European Union slapped an asset freeze and travel ban on 13 Russian and eight Crimean leaders, the bloc's first significant sanctions against Moscow for its incursion into Ukraine. EU officials decided against targeting President Vladimir Putin's inner circle, as the U.S. did earlier in the day, despite some European foreign ministers urging the bloc to take such action. The move came a day after residents of Crimea voted overwhelmingly to leave Ukraine and join Russia in a referendum denounced by Western leaders as illegal and rigged. That vote has the U.S. and Europe on edge over whether Russia will raise the stakes further by annexing Crimea or sending troops into eastern Ukraine. ""There is a lot of danger concerning German companies and their relationships with Russia,"" said Michael Schroeder, who heads ZEW's international finance department. Despite the crisis in the Crimea, the indicator's level suggests the economic upswing in Europe's largest economy is currently not at risk, ZEW said. The 241 analysts and institutional investors surveyed were more positive about Germany's economic conditions. The ZEW indicator for current conditions rose to 51.3 from February's 50.0, reaching its highest level since August 2011. The DAX also shrugged off the drop in economic expectations. ""No matter how delicate the current political relationship with Russia might be, the short-term impact on the German economy should be limited, "" Carsten Brzeski, economist with ING Bank said. Last week, the country's central bank said domestic demand should help raise Germany's economic growth rate this year and next, citing Germany's low unemployment rate and wage growth. These factors combined with record low interest rates in the euro zone are fueling housing construction in particular, it added. Consumption in Germany has driven economic growth over the past two to three years, and should continue to do so despite the situation in Crimea, Mr. Schroeder added.

"MOSCOW (AP) — Russia has angrily criticized the latest U.S. sanctions, saying they could derail cooperation with Washington on dealing with the Iranian nuclear standoff and the Syrian crisis. Russia-U.S. ties have plunged to post-Cold War lows over Ukraine as Washington has introduced economic sanctions against Moscow for its annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula and support for a pro-Russian insurgency in eastern Ukraine. In the latest move, the U.S. has imposed sanctions on four Russians under a law targeting Russian human rights violators. The Russian Foreign Ministry on Tuesday dismissed the new U.S. sanctions as unfounded and warned Washington that its actions ""are putting in question the prospects for bilateral cooperation in settling the situation around the Iranian nuclear program, the Syrian crisis and other acute international problems."""
"Moscow, April 16 (Jiji Press)--Russian President Vladimir Putin said Thursday that Moscow is ready to hold territorial talks with Japan but that Tokyo's move has effectively halted such talks. Russia's annexation of Crimea in March last year has not changed its approach in relations with Japan over a possible peace treaty or a territorial issue, Putin told reporters after attending a TV program, indicating the Crimea issue does not affect bilateral talks over four Russian-held northwestern Pacific islands off Japan's northernmost prefecture of Hokkaido. The dispute over the islands claimed by Japan has prevented the two countries from concluding a peace treaty. Putin agreed in talks with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe last November that the two sides would prepare for his visit to Japan at an appropriate time this year. However, sanctions by Japan, the United States and Europe against Russia after the Crimea annexation have stalled relations between Tokyo and Moscow. Putin apparently blamed Japan for soured relations but tried to rule out the view that Russian people's patriotic sentiment raised by the Crimea annexation has an adverse impact on territorial talks between the two countries. The Russian president has invited Abe to attend a ceremony in Moscow on May 9 to mark the 70th anniversary of the former Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany, but the Japanese side has yet to give a reply on whether Abe will join. In the TV program, Putin criticized that the United States had exerted pressure on countries which do not plan to attend the ceremony. END [Jiji Press]"
"MOSCOW, Jan. 18 -- The United States on Thursday condemned the parliament of Ukraine's decision to pass wide-ranging laws severely restricting the right to protest as undemocratic. The measures were stiffly resisted by outraged opposition deputies in a testy, and sometimes violent, session in the Rada, but were nonetheless pushed through by the ruling pro-presidential Party of Regions. 'Both the process and the substance of the Rada's actions today cast serious doubt on Ukraine's commitment to democratic norms,' the US State Department said in a statement following Thursday's parliamentary session. The legislation passed by the Rada was apparently aimed at curtailing street demonstrations sparked by President Viktor Yanukovych's decision to back off from signing key integration agreements with the European Union in November. US and EU diplomats also condemned Ukraine's parliament for violations of procedure. Laws were approved swiftly and largely without formal debate. Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt warned of 'dark designs against democracy"" in a post on Twitter. The restrictive laws drew swift criticism from rights organizations. 'It is disheartening to watch the democratically elected government of Ukraine moving further away from the democratic aspirations of the people of Ukraine,' said David Kramer, head of US-based rights advocacy group Freedom House. The bill passed by the Rada, which must be signed by Yanukovych to become law, included jail terms for protesters that block entrances to government buildings and threatens arrest for those who take part in unsanctioned demonstrations or who wear helmets or masks during rallies. Measures also reportedly include new restrictions on Ukrainain NGOs apparently modelled on a similar law passed by Russia earlier this year, restrictions on the Internet and harsher punishments for extremism. The parliamentary session took place amid scenes of chaos. Votes were counted by a show of hands, one deputy was pictured with bloody face after fist fights broke out between rival factions and opposition deputies occupied the rostrum in bid to stop the passage of the bill. Opposition leaders in Ukraine compared the actions of the Party of the Regions to a coup, according to a BBC report. Ukraine has been convulsed by mass street demonstrations since Yanukovych halted preparations to sign a long-planned free trade deal with the EU, and agreed a deal with Russia deepening economic ties. Protesters have also occupied government buildings, and established barricades and a permanent tented camp in the center of the capital, Kiev.

"PAGE: http://civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=27856 ) TITLE: Latvian FM Lays Out EaP Riga Summit Goals SECTION: politics AUTHOR: ""Civil Georgia"" PUBDATE: 27 Nov.'14 (civil.georgia /politics) - Latvia wants the Eastern Partnership (EaP) summit in Riga in late May to become “another milestone” for Georgia’s “closer integration” into Europe, Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkēvičs said after talks with his Georgian counterpart Tamar Beruchashvili in Tbilisi on November 26. Speaking at a news conference after the meeting, Rinkēvičs, who is accompanying Latvian President Andris Bērziņš on his two-day official visit to Georgia, laid out some of the targets Latvia wants to achieve at the Riga Summit planned for May 21-22, 2015. “First of all I think that Georgia’s progress must be acknowledged in Riga,” said the Latvian Foreign Minister, whose country will be holding EU’s rotating presidency in the first half of next year. “We see that Georgia has made enormous efforts in reforms. There are also some areas where some particular attention should be focused – the judicial system,” he said. “We have to differentiate our Eastern partners and clearly Georgia and Moldova are frontrunners in the Eastern Partnership and we believe that in Riga summit there is a need for a roadmap for those two countries when it comes to their deeper and broader cooperation with the European Union,” Rinkēvičs said. He said that the roadmap should include more effort from the EU to assist Georgia including in the context of implementation of the Association Agreement, particularly the deep and comprehensive free trade part of that treaty. Rinkēvičs also said that Latvia wants to have “substantial aid package, as well as a roadmap” for Ukraine, and “very flexible relations” with three other Eastern Partnership members – Armenia, Azerbaijan and Belarus. “Second, we definitely want to see Riga Summit as a visa liberalisation summit with those countries that are fulfilling our [EU] criteria,” the Latvian Foreign Minister said. The EU said in late October that Georgia fulfilled first-phase requirements under the visa liberalisation dialogue with the EU, which paved the way for the launch of the second phase. The first phase benchmarks included the overall policy framework, involving adoption of relevant legislation, and the second phase benchmarks involve putting into practice effective and sustainable implementation of these relevant measures and legislation. Georgia now wants to get a positive assessment from the EU on the implementation of the second-phase benchmarks by the time of the Riga Summit. “If all the issues are solved and there is a positive [European] Commission report, we will do our best to ensure that Riga Summit becomes a summit, where visa liberalisation program is enacted with Georgia, hopefully also with Ukraine; also very much looking forward for the same with Belarus – of course Belarus started the preparatory work a bit late, however, they are doing a great progress,” the Latvian Foreign Minister said. “I also hope that we will be able to expand cooperation between the EU and Georgia in such fields like common security and defense policy, as well as energy policy,” Rinkēvičs said.   “We are ready to work with our friends in Georgia so that Riga summit becomes another milestone in closer cooperation, in closer integration of Georgia into the Euro-Atlantic community,” he said. He also said that as preparation process for the summit is underway, Latvia is open to suggestions from Georgia. With Georgian colleague Tamar Beruchashvili signing Memorandum of Understanding between MFAs of Georgia and Latvia pic.twitter.com/HSUbe7sXZT Latvian President Andris Bērziņš, who met his Georgian counterpart Giorgi Margvelashvili earlier on November 26, said that the Eastern Partnership will be among “top priorities” of Latvia’s EU presidency. “I hope that Eastern Partnership summit in Riga organized next year will be able to emphasize significant progress of Georgia as regards to reforms,” he said. President Bērziņš is accompanied by seven ministers and over 70 representatives of the Latvian business community, who participated on November 26 in a joint Latvian-Georgian business forum in Tbilisi. A business forum will also be held in Batumi on Georgia’s Black Sea coast, which the Georgian and Latvian Presidents plan to visit on November 27. “One of the main purposes of our visit is strengthening and deepening of economic cooperation [with Georgia]. I think that this visit may be a turning point towards further expansion of our cooperation,” President Bērziņš said. In Tbilisi the Latvian President also met PM Irakli Garibashvili and parliament speaker Davit Usupashvili. Speaking at a joint news conference after the meeting with his Georgian counterpart, President Bērziņš said that the regional security was among the issues discussed. He said that newly signed treaty between Russia and Georgia’s breakaway region of Abkhazia on alliance and strategic partnership will “negatively affect regional stability.” The Latvian President, however, also said: “We have to find ways how to stabilize our relations with our neighbors, including Russia. We will do our best to stabilize those [relations], to have long-term peaceful and stable relations; it will take time.” President Margvelashvili said that Georgia, Ukraine, and Moldova “should not be punished for their free choice.” “The choice of Georgia, Ukraine, Moldova should be protected,” the Georgian President said."
"PAGE: http://english.caixin.cn/2014-08-16/100717681.html ) TITLE: A Modern Reflection of Germany and Austria-Hungary? SECTION: Opinion AUTHOR: Artyom Lukin PUBDATE: 08.16.2014 18:21 (Caixin Wang) - China's burdens of geography could lead to a relationship with Russia bearing historical parallels to Bismarckian Germany 2014 has seen, ironically, not just the centenary of the start of the First World War, but also troubling parallels to the Balkans in the Western post-Soviet region which – as has become particularly apparent due to the recent crisis in Ukraine – is characterized by unrecognized borders, weak sovereignties, great-power rivalries. Meanwhile, on the eastern flank of Eurasia, the current developments may be less dramatic but potentially even more perilous. More than a few scholars have found similarities between Europe in the period preceding World War I and what we are now witnessing in Asia. Even contemporary politicians cannot resist the temptation of drawing historical parallels, with Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe declaring early this year that the increasing tensions between China and Japan were similar to the competition between Germany and Britain before World War I. There is indeed an array of parallels between the pre-World War I Europe and contemporary Asia, including a lack of mutual trust, Mutual animosities and hatreds rooted in not-so-distant, alliance entrapment, the rising tide of nationalism, the dominance of the Westphalian nation-state, the concentration of great powers, power shifts and dissatisfaction with status quo, conflict triggers and a race for space. Then as now, economic interdependence is not nearly enough to secure peace. Will Russia become China's Austria-Hungary? China's own power base, even when developed to its full capacity, will be insufficient to compete for geopolitical primacy with the combined might of the U.S. and its allies. The only realistic option for Beijing to substantially augment its power is through external balancing, that is by allying with another major player. The only great power potentially available for such an alliance is Russia. If Sino-American rivalry goes from its currently more or less subdued mode to an open clash, Russia would find itself in a pivotal position. Thus, even short of an alliance, good relations with Russia give China huge strategic benefits. With Moscow as a close friend, China can be confident about the security of its northern borders and can count on unimpeded access to Russia's natural resources. Should they form an entente, Moscow and Beijing could have Central Asia, as well as Mongolia, to themselves, effectively shutting out all external powers from the heart of Eurasia. An alliance with Moscow would also put Russia's military-industrial complex and vast military infrastructure in Eurasia to Beijing's service. There is a greater possibility and potential in a Sino-Russia rapprochement than is commonly accepted in the West. Any Sino-Russian strategic partnership is often portrayed as an ""axis of convenience"" founded on a shaky basis. Moscow, the argument goes, will be wary of an alliance with Beijing because it distrusts and fears a rising China. The main problem with such thinking is that the U.S.-led West is seen by Moscow as a much bigger threat than China. The consensus in the Kremlin is that, for at least the next 20 years China will not pose a threat to Russia, Beijing's and Moscow's common main adversary being the U.S. It is a cruel irony that the Ukraine crisis should have broken out at the year of the 100th anniversary of the Great War. Russia's current stance toward Ukraine is reminiscent of how, in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, Austria-Hungary felt about the Balkans, which it deemed its vital sphere of influence. The fear of losing control over the Balkans drove Austria-Hungary into the embrace of Imperial Germany, even though Vienna and Berlin had traditionally vied for control of Central Europe and fought a war in 1866. The alliance of Germany and Austria-Hungary contributed to Europe's splitting into two camps and eventually general war. Could this be the model for the Sino-Russian dyad? Just like Vienna and Berlin, Moscow and Beijing have had a historically complicated relationship, but this may not preclude them forming an entente. Challenging Russia in its ""Balkans"" – Ukraine and the post-Soviet space generally, which the Russians characteristically call ""near abroad"" – the West raises the likelihood of turning Russia into a modern-day Austria-Hungary, a besieged great power seeking support from an aspiring super power and thus becoming its junior ally. The contemporary strategic picture in Asia has a number of striking, and alarming, similarities with the pre-World War I Europe. This does not mean that war is imminent but while we have not yet passed the point of no return beyond which strategic partnerships gel into political-military alliances, we may be fast approaching this point. It is important to see Eurasia as a single geopolitical space, where Europe, the Middle East, Central, South and East Asia are increasingly linked together. Zbigniew Brzezinski's metaphor of Eurasia as a grand chess board is now more relevant than ever. What happens in Europe inevitably affects Asia, and vice versa. Instead of Europe and Asia as separate units, perhaps it makes more sense geopolitically to refer to the western and eastern wings of the single Eurasia. Russia, China and the U.S. are the three most powerful strategic actors in Eurasia, and on the world stage, and are likely to remain so for at least the next 20 years. The accommodation among the U.S., China and Russia must form the initial basis for a multipolar and multilateral international architecture, in which other Eurasian players should also be invested and engaged. To be sure, this will be an immensely difficult task, but in trying to accomplish it we will at least have the benefit of historical lessons.

Arsen Avakov announced on his Facebook page that ""all security units"" were involved in an ""anti-terror operation"" in the eastern city of Sloviansk. Russia warned earlier that any use of force in eastern Ukraine could scupper crisis talks due later this week. The US accuses Moscow of inciting the trouble. The Kremlin denies the charge. Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the Kiev government was ""demonstrating its inability to take responsibility for the fate of the country"". But the US said there had been a ""concerted campaign"" by forces with Russian support to undermine the authorities in Kiev. US Secretary of State John Kerry warned of ""additional consequences"" if Russia failed to make efforts to ""de-escalate"" and pull its troops back from Ukraine's border. Four-party talks involving Ukraine, Russia, the US and the EU are due to start in Geneva on Thursday. On Saturday, armed men took over police stations and official buildings in Sloviansk and two other eastern towns - Kramatorsk and Druzhkovka. Similar reports emerged from Sloviansk and Kramatorsk of armed men dressed in camouflage arriving in buses and storming the police stations. Pro-Russian demonstrators also continued their occupation of the main administrative building in the regional capital Donetsk, which they have held for one week. A protest leader told the BBC that the activists in Sloviansk took action to support the Donetsk sit-in. Mr Avakov labelled the actions a ""display of aggression by Russia"". Eastern Ukraine has a large Russian-speaking population and has seen a series of protests since the ousting of Ukraine's pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych in February."
"Pakistan on Monday suspended expeditions on its second-highest peak, evacuating climbers from Nanga Parbat after 10 foreign tourists were shot dead by Islamist gunmen at a base camp. Well-armed and well-prepared attackers dressed in police uniforms stormed the camp at the foot of Nanga Parbat late Saturday, shooting dead the climbers and a Pakistani guide at point-blank range, officials said. The victims have been identified as an American with dual Chinese citizenship, three Ukrainians, two Slovakians, two others from China, a Lithuanian and a climber from Nepal. It was an unprecedented attack on mountaineers drawn to the natural beauty and intrepid climbing of northern Pakistan, which until Saturday's shooting was considered immune from Taliban and Al-Qaeda-linked violence plaguing other parts of the country. ""We are really shocked, traumatised and full of anger. Pakistan is known among the mountaineering community. It was a brutal massacre. These people were killed for no reason,"" said Manzoor Hussain, president of the Alpine Club of Pakistan. Around 40 remaining climbers on Nanga Parbat have been evacuated to the northern city of Gilgit with treks on the peak now unsafe, he told AFP. ""Local authorities have evacuated them. They have all been informed of this incident,"" Hussain said. ""We are reviewing the overall security situation. The fallout apparently will be serious."" Hussain said there would be no further expeditions on Nanga Parbat this summer and that requests for winter climbs would be subject to a security review. ""This season is over for them,"" Hussain said. It is a major blow to foreign trekking expeditions, which provide the last vestige of international tourism in a country where Islamist militants have killed thousand of people in recent years. Pakistan's umbrella Taliban movement claimed responsibility for the shootings, saying they had set up a new faction, Junood ul-Hifsa, to kill foreigners to avenge US drone strikes on Taliban and Al-Qaeda operatives. Hussain said the attack was well-planned, carried out by well-equipped and well-trained people familiar with the harsh terrain, with suspected local involvement. ""It took place at 4,200 metres. It has to be the work of well-trained people. It takes two to three days to reach (the camp). The body needs to acclimatise for climbing up. How they went undetected is a big question."" Expeditions on other peaks in Pakistan higher than 8,000 metres, including K2 the world's second highest mountain, would continue as the army was in those areas, he said. The bodies of the dead tourists were on Sunday flown to Islamabad from where they will be repatriated. Police said Monday that a massive search operation is under way to track down the suspects. ""The military, police, law enforcement agencies are all involved. The terrain is tough. Four helicopters are also combing the suspected areas,"" police official Mohammed Naveed told AFP from the district of Diamer. ""This is the most peaceful area in Pakistan. Such an incident never happened before. We're also interrogating local people. The operation will continue until we achieve the objective,"" he said. sz-jm/lm"
"Parliament in Ukraine's Crimea backs government's decision to halt EU deal Excerpt from report by Ukrainian Crimean official news agency website KIA on 22 November The presidium of the Supreme Council of the ARC [Autonomous Republic of Crimea] has supported the decision of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine on suspending arrangements for signing an association agreement between Ukraine and the EU. This is mentioned in the Crimean parliament's official statement, the text of which was received by the Crimean news agency [KIA]. ""We believe that the decision, which is beyond any political dimension, is of completely pragmatic nature and aimed at preventing the escalation of crisis developments in the country's economy and social sector,"" the document says. Parliament expressed concern over the destructive actions of the opposition political forces, which created hysteria over the association agreement between Ukraine and the EU. ""We are confident that the opposition leaders' attempts to destabilize the situation in Ukraine have nothing to do with the true interests of our country's residents. We share the Ukrainian leaders' unwillingness to get closer to the European Union at the expense of the severance of economic ties with our main trade partner, the Russian Federation. We should not forget that not only economic benefits from bilateral cooperation link us to Russia. For the majority of Ukraine's resident, this is a fraternal country where fraternal peoples live,"" the statement said. [Passage omitted: background on Ukraine's decision to halt EU association deal].  "
"Politics AUTHOR: Reuters PUBDATE: 6/28/2015 12:23:02 PM ( VOV News) - Tour companies were evacuating thousands of foreign holidaymakers from Tunisia on June 27, a day after a gunman killed 39 people at a beach hotel in an attack claimed by Islamic State. Tunisia's Prime Minister Habib Essid said most of the dead were British, and Britain's foreign office said 15 Britons had been confirmed killed in the attack in the resort town of Sousse, 140 km (90 miles) south of the capital Tunis. A German, a Belgian and an Irish woman have also been identified, foreign and Tunisian officials said. It was the second major attack in the North African country this year, following an Islamist militant assault on the Bardo Museum in Tunis in March when gunmen killed a group of foreign visitors as they arrived by bus. Tunisia has undergone a largely peaceful transition to democracy since its 2011 Arab Spring uprising, but its army has been fighting a rise in Islamist militancy. Tunisia's tourism minister called the attack on June 26 in one of the country's most popular resorts for Europeans a ""catastrophe"" and authorities vowed to toughen security, drafting in army reserves and arming tourism police at beaches and hotels. Saloua Kadri, Sousse tourism commissioner, said more than 3,000 foreign tourists had fled the town on Saturday, including around 2,200 British and nearly 600 Belgians. Dozens of tourists were waiting to take flights out from the nearby Ennfida airport. ""We don't want to stay any longer, we just want to see our family, parents ... so leaving as soon as possible,"" said Hannah Russel, an British tourist. Sarah Maeson, another Briton flying back to Manchester, said: ""We don't feel safe. Constantly hearing sirens and helicopters is not really helping your nerves."" EXTRA FLIGHTS Tunisian authorities named the gunman as Saif Rezgui, a student who they say was not known to them. Dressed in shorts and T-shirt, Rezgui opened fire on the beach of the Imperial Marhaba hotel on Friday, picking out foreigners and leaving Tunisians alive. Witnesses said he made his way to the pool and hotel, his killing spree ending only when he was shot dead by police. Tour operators Thomson and First Choice, which are owned by German travel group TUI, said they had about 6,400 customers across Tunisia at the time of the attack, including several of the people killed and injured. They sent 10 planes to evacuate tourists and said 1,000 had already been repatriated. They also said they would cancel all their holiday packages to Tunisia for at least the next week. TUI's German tour operator TUI also organized flights for tourists wishing to return home and TUI's Belgian airline, Jetairfly, sent six empty planes to bring tourists back from the island of Djerba and from Ennfida airport on June 27. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier confirmed one German had been killed, but said there may be others. Tobias Ellwood, a junior minister at Britain's foreign office, told reporters in London the British death toll could rise as there were several who had been seriously wounded. ""This is the most significant terrorist attack on British people since 7/7,"" he said, referring to attacks on the London transport system on July 7, 2005, that killed 52 people. NOT ON WATCHLIST Tunisian authorities said the gunman was not on any watchlist of known potential militants. But one source said Rezgui appeared to have been radicalized over the last six months by Islamist militant recruiters. As one countermeasure, Prime Minister Essid said that Tunisia planned within a week to close down 80 mosques that remain outside state control for inciting violence. Several thousand Tunisian jihadists have gone to fight in Syria, Iraq and neighboring Libya, where some have set up training camps and vowed to return to attack their homeland. The attack took place during the holy Muslim month of Ramadan and was one of three linked to Islamist militants on three different continents on June 26. In France, a decapitated body daubed with Arabic writing was found, and in Kuwait a suicide bomber killed two dozen people at a mosque in Kuwait."
"Prague, March 15 (CTK) - The second group of ethnic Czechs, who decided to move from Ukraine to their original homeland over the security situation, arrived at Prague airport where they were welcomed by President Milos Zeman, Interior Minister Milan Chovanec and Foreign Minister Lubomir Zaoralek today. This 35-member group consists of 13 families, mostly from the Odessa region. One family is from the Donetsk region and two are from Chekhohrad, an east Ukrainian town situated not far from the area of the recent fighting between the Ukrainian army and pro-Russian separatists. Some of the Ukrainians of Czech origin have relatives who moved to the Czech Republic several years before. The first group of the expatriates, comprising 44 people from Chekhohrad, arrived in Prague on March 3. Some other expatriates came to the Czech Republic by car. Others who have been granted permanent residence permits are expected to be coming later on. Czech authorities have issued 150 permits in shortened proceedings, mostly to expatriates from southern and eastern Ukraine. The government has set aside 66 million crowns for the repatriation programme, mainly for people with Czech roots from Ukraine. They should be provided with free accommodation for six to 12 months, financial aid of up to 50,000 crowns per adult and 20,000 per child, and assistance in moving their property to the Czech Republic and looking for permanent housing and jobs. The programme was worked out after several hundred Ukrainian Czechs sent a repatriation request to President Milos Zeman last year. It applies to Czech expatriates all over the world who would find themselves in an emergency situation similar to the present one in Ukraine. Like the first group, also the second group will move to a state-owned hotel in Cervena nad Vltavou, southern Bohemia. ($1=25.832 crowns) kva/dr"
"Prague, March 9 (CTK) - A possible intervention by NATO in Crimea, which has been allegedly occupied by Russian soldiers, is out of question, Czech Defence Minister Martin Stropnicky (ANO) said on Prime television today and he came out in favour of a diplomatic solution to the ""Crimea crisis."" He said he expects the monitoring mission of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which has not yet succeeded in stepping on the peninsula, to fail. Stropnicky said no one can believe that a NATO intervention in Crimea could solve anything. He said Ukraine is not a NATO member and the issue would have to be dealt with by the U.N. Security Council, of which Russia is a member. Stropnicky said he does not believe that it would be right to demonstrate military force to Russia. He said the West does not have any broad space for sanctions against Russia due to the economic interconnection and added that a diplomatic solution would not be ""entirely toothless."" ""The diplomatic pressure can be stepped up,"" Stropnicky said without elaborating. Pro-Russian guards have not yet let OSCE monitors enter Crimea. ""I would by no means recommend that members of the mission try to get to Crimea at any cost,"" Stropnicky said and added that it is important that they get back in order. ms/dr"

"Russia has begun war games near Ukraine after denouncing as a ""grave crime"" Kiev's security-service strike against pro-Moscow rebels. Ukrainian officials said five militants were killed yesterday when special forces stormed rebel roadblocks near the eastern city of Slovyansk, a stronghold for activists who want the industrial Donetsk region to split with Kiev's new pro-EU government. The militants said two of their men had been killed and vowed to resist any attempt to storm Slovyansk, which is one of about 10 eastern towns and cities where official buildings have been occupied by activists, allegedly with help from Russian agents. Kerry warning Last night US secretary of state John Kerry said it was drawing closer to imposing more sanctions on Russia by saying time was running out for Moscow to change course. In unsually blunt comments, Mr Kerry accused Russia of using propaganda to hide what he said it was actually trying to do in eastern Ukraine: destabilise that region and undermine next month's planned Ukrainian elections. ""The window to change course is closing,"" he told reporters. ""If Russia chooses the path of de-escalation . . . all of us will welcome it. But if Russia does not, the world will make sure that the costs for Russia will only grow. It will be an expensive mistake."" Moscow denies sending operatives into Ukraine and has warned that it will respond if its interests or citizens are harmed in the country, which Russian president Vladimir Putin has said could plunge into civil war if troops are used to quash unrest. ""If it's true that the current regime in Kiev sent the army against citizens inside its country, then it is a very serious crime against its own people,"" Mr Putin declared yesterday, saying that such actions would make Ukraine's leaders a ""junta"". ""It is a punitive operation that will have consequences for the people who make these decisions, including upon relations between our countries. We'll see how the situation develops and we'll make conclusions based on the reality on the ground."" Shortly after Mr Putin spoke in St Petersburg, Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu announced the start of military exercises near the border with Ukraine - where the US and Nato say Moscow has concentrated some 40,000 troops and armour. ""The order has already been given by the [Kiev] authorities for the use of force against civilians . . . We are forced to react to such a development in the situation,"" Mr Shoigu said. Mr Shoigu said battalions from Russia's southern and western military districts would begin exercises in regions bordering Ukraine, and that ""the air force will conduct flights to train for manoeuvres along state frontiers"". Damanded explanation Ukraine demanded an explanation from Russia within 48 hours. Visiting Prague, Kiev's foreign minister Andriy Deshchytsia said: ""We will now fight with Russian troops if . . . they invade Ukraine. Ukrainian people and the Ukrainian army are ready to do this."" Russia does not recognise the legitimacy of Ukraine's new pro-western government, which took power in February after protests ousted Kremlin ally president Viktor Yanukovich. Kiev accuses Russia of destabilising Ukraine and possibly planning to invade or foment enough civil strife to split the country. - (addional reporting Reuters )"

"Russia's ambassador to Australia has emerged from an official call-up to the Foreign Affairs Department in Canberra, warning that his country will act to ""ensure the interests"" of Russians in Ukraine. Ukraine's Crimean peninsula has become the focus of one of the most alarming confrontations between Russia and the West since the fall of the Soviet Union. Russia's Black Sea fleet is based on the peninsula at the port city of Sevastopol and Russian forces and pro-Russian activists have mobilised throughout the region, surrounding official buildings and military bases. Australia's Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop called in the Russian ambassador to ""explain the intentions of the Russian government and also to give us an opportunity to officially register our concern"". She says the Government is deeply troubled by the escalating military activity but is not yet moving to recall Australia's ambassador to Russia. ""This must be resolved by Russia withdrawing its troops and all lines of communication should remain open,"" she said. ""We don't know where this is heading, it is very volatile at the moment. But we are urging calm and discussion, dialogue and diplomacy."" Ms Bishop says Australia is also making that point as a member of the UN Security Council, which has already met twice to consider the conflict. Russian ambassador Vladimir Morozov has this morning met Department of Foreign Affairs secretary Peter Varghese. Mr Morozov said Russia shared Australia's concerns about stability in Ukraine but also made it clear that the dispute would not be easily resolved. ""We are not going to tolerate any harassment of our counterparts in Crimea,"" he said. ""Of course the Russian government is going to do everything what is in its capacity to ensure the interests of the Russian population in Crimea."" Labor backbencher Kelvin Thomson says Australia must consider sanctions against Russia. ""A couple of years ago we entered into a trade deal involving uranium sales to Russia,"" he said. ""I think we might need to revisit that."" A visit to Russia by Trade Minister Andrew Robb scheduled for next week has been cancelled and the ABC understands the Government also revoked the invitation for a Russian national security adviser to visit Australia. DFAT is warning Australians not to travel to Crimea and for any Australians in the area to leave. Canada has recalled its ambassador to Moscow and suspended cooperation in the G8, which is currently chaired by Russia."
"Salzburg (8 September) -- Ignoring international law leads to erosion of the global order and to the stronger and more assertive countries making their own rules in their areas of interest. This was a point made by Miroslav Lajcak, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign and European Affairs of the Slovak Republic, during a discussion at the Salzburg Forum of the International Peace Institute. ""Slovakia has always put emphasis on adherence to international law. That is the decisive principle to us and not something one can pick from to satisfy the needs at that moment,"" stated Minister Lajcak in the panel discussion on the topic of how to strike a balance between the territorial integrity principle and the right to self-determination. The co-discussants were Bogdan Aurescu, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Romania, and John Packer, Professor of International Law at Ottawa University. “If we do not respect universal and internationally agreed rules, the danger is that we will set a precedence and offer excuses to those players who will make their own rules to pursue their interests in the areas of their influence,"" warned Minister Lajcak while emphasizing that territorial integrity and the right to self-determination are two fundamental principles for existence of states and also for the international order and they have to be applied so as to avoid conflict. ""They frequently clash but in their essence they do not oppose each other and give no right at all to use force,"" added Minister Lajcak. He also recalled the recent historical experience of the split-up of Czechoslovakia, the former Yugoslavia and the current developments in Ukraine. ""There is no threat of a conflict and confrontation if the right to self-determination is applied through agreement by the involved parties, in accordance with international legal regulations, just as was the case of Czechoslovakia's separation. If the concerned parties fail to reach an agreement, the international community has to assume the role as arbitrator and manage the entire process, using the tools of preventive diplomacy – that was the case of Montenegro becoming independent from the joint ties with Serbia. The worst thing is when one of the parties takes unilateral action or forces solutions that give rise to long-lasting problems,” said Minister Lajcak at the Salzburg Forum."
"Section: General News - U.S. President Barack Obama says he believes democracy and the rule of law will triumph in Ukraine. Obama spoke late Wednesday to an enthusiastic audience at Brussels' Palais des Beaux Arts, after meetings with European Union and NATO officials. He said Western powers do not have any plans to try to dislodge Russia from Crimea by force. But he said over time, if the West remains united, Russia will recognize that it cannot use brute force to achieve its goals. Obama also said there was no evidence of violence against ethnic Russians in Ukraine as Moscow has claimed, and he rejected Russian criticisms of NATO actions in Kosovo and the U.S. invasion of Iraq, saying that NATO only intervened in Kosovo after its people were brutalized, and that the U.S. never sought to annex Iraq as Russia has done in Crimea. He also said NATO would step up its presence in new east European member states bordering on Russia and Ukraine to provide reassurance that the alliance's mutual defense guarantee would protect them. Meetings with EU leaders stress unity Earlier Wednesday, Obama said after meeting with EU leaders that the international community is united in its determination to isolate Russia because of its annexation of Crimea, and that the issue highlights the need for Europe to find other sources for its energy supplies. Referring to Russia's annexation of Crimea, Obama said that Moscow's actions in Ukraine are not just about one country, but about the respect of sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries, and about respect of international law. That is what Russia violated, said Obama speaking at a joint news conference with Jose Manuel Barroso, President of the European Commission, and Herman Van Rompuy, President of the European Council. Obama said that the U.S. and the EU are forming a united front and that consequences for Russia will continue to grow in response to its actions in Ukraine. ""Europe and America are united in our support of the Ukrainian government and the Ukrainian people; we're united in imposing a cost on Russia for its actions so far,"" said Obama. He said Russia's energy sector could be the next target of economic sanctions by the United States and the European Union. Obama told reporters in Brussels that NATO needs a regular presence in countries that feel vulnerable to Russia. He said the situation in Ukraine is a reminder that ""freedom isn't free"" and added that collective defense means ""everybody's got to chip in"" to maintain a deterrent force. U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel said Wednesday that Russia has continued to build up military forces along its border with Ukraine, despite assurances it has no intention to invade. Meanwhile, the World Bank said in a report published Wednesday that if Moscow's standoff with the West over Crimea intensifies, the Russian economy could contract 1.8 percent in 2014 and investors could pull a record $150 billion out of the country. President Vladimir Putin's popularity rating has soared with Crimea's annexation: a poll published Wednesday by the Levada Center, an independent Russian polling agency, found that public support for Mr. Putin had risen to 80 percent during the past week. However, Boris Nemtsov, a former Russian deputy prime minister who is now a democratic opposition leader, told VOA's Russian service that Mr. Putin's popularity could drop as Russians start to feel the costs of the move into Crimea. When citizens realize they have to pay for this adventure out of their own pockets, they will start to sober up, Nemtsov said. Images from Crimea Russia denounced at rights forum More than 40 mainly Western countries led by the U.S. on Wednesday denounced Russia's annexation of Crimea and voiced concern for the fate of minority Tatars as well as missing activists and journalists. In a joint statement to the United Nations Human Rights Council, they urged Russia to allow international monitors to deploy across Ukraine, including Crimea. Russia has agreed with the 56 other members of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to send a six-month monitoring mission to Ukraine, but said it had no mandate in Crimea. Paula Schriefer, U.S. deputy secretary of state, read a two-page statement to the Geneva forum from 42 countries, saying: We call on Russia and all concerned to ensure full and unimpeded access and protection for the teams to all of Ukraine, including Crimea.... We are deeply concerned about credible reports of kidnappings of journalists and activists, the blocking of independent media and the barring of independent international observers, she said. Furthermore, the situation of minorities in Crimea, in particular the Crimean Tatars, is extremely vulnerable since the Russian military incursion, Schriefer said. IMF bailout The International Monetary Fund is expected to announce a bailout package for Ukraine of about $15 billion as early as Thursday, the Financial Times said, citing officials involved in the negotiations. The IMF had considered a quick infusion of $1 billion from its so-called rapid financing instrument, according to the newspaper. However, it said the IMF now hopes to agree to the larger rescue package by the end of Wednesday and announce the deal Thursday morning. Ukrainian Finance Minister Olexandr Shlapak on Tuesday said Kyiv was negotiating for a loan package of between $15 billion and $20 billion. Ukraine bond prices ticked higher and the cost to insure its debt fell to the lowest level in a month following the report on Wednesday. Ukraine loses last Crimean ship Russian forces have taken over the Ukrainian minesweeper Cherkasy, the last military ship controlled by Ukraine in Crimea, in an operation in which they used stun grenades and fired in the air, Ukrainian naval sources said on Wednesday. There were no injuries and the crew remained on board until the morning when they went ashore. During the take-over, which began on Tuesday evening, the minesweeper used water cannons in an effort to repel the Russian forces who had approached the Cherkasy in speedboats. Russians threw stun grenades and fired small arms, apparently in the air, a navy source said. Russian forces have used similar tactics to seize ships and military bases from the last remaining Ukrainian troops in Crimea. - VOA Some reporting by Reuters."
"Sergey Petrov has made a fortune with his car selling chain Rolf.  Now, since 2007, the multi-millionaire has sat on the Lower House for the Siberian industrial city of Orenburg. In the Duma, he belongs to the parliamentary group of ""Just Russia,"" a party that has increasingly distanced itself from the Kremlin since 2010.  In 1992, Petrov's company started with the sale of 109 Mitsubishi cars.  Today, he sells 16 brands, including Audi, Mercedes, Jaguar, Porsche, Skoda, Ford, and Jeep.  In 2013, Rolf sold 80,168 new cars and 17,000 used cars.  The business magazine Forbes estimates Petrov's assets at $750 million. [Brueggmann]  Mr. Petrov, on 21 March, the Duma will vote on the integration of Crimea into the Russian Federation.  What do you expect? [Petrov]  Many deputies are afraid of being put on the West's sanctions list if they vote in favor of it.  But the Kremlin exerts great pressure on us.  This is why it will probably be done by anonymous voting. [Brueggmann]  What are the consequences of the crisis for Russia? [Petrov]  Already before the crisis, our economy was very weak.  Now, there is slight panic as far as a decline of the ruble exchange rate is concerned.  The people are trying to quickly buy things because the situation will deteriorate.  The government's liberal wing is getting weaker; the nationalist tendencies are getting stronger.  In Russia, people who are incompetent on economic matters are responsible for the country's economy. [Brueggmann]  Who decides about economic reforms in Moscow today? [Petrov]  This is increasingly the task of former KGB [Committee for State Security] officers and so-called Silowiki, representatives of security services, who are not really interested in market economy and economic matters in general.  The remaining reformers, who are increasingly being attacked by far-left spending fanatics and populist economists, justify their staying in the government by stating that, if they left, things would even get worse. [Brueggmann]  Does the Kremlin see the need to take economic policy countermeasures?  After all, in January, investments fell by 7 percent, economic growth turned negative; capital flight is rapidly increasing. [Petrov]  This is why national investment programs are being discussed now, in an attempt to stop the growing social dissatisfaction for a short time.  But they will not stop the economic decline.  Moreover, the industry suffers from bureaucratic pressure.  Half of the industry is controlled by the state, which acts increasingly inefficiently.  Other parts are a nomenclature business of oligarchs.  Such structures kill the market.  The Duma passes 500 laws annually, most of which are bans and regulations. [Brueggmann]  How does the investment climate develop? [Petrov]  Currently, it is deteriorating further.  Owners are coming under pressure.  Therefore, Russian business people increasingly invest in the West -- some of them with limited success because they lack experience.  All this does not help the Russian economy and the medium-sized businesses, which are a major pillar.  But apparently, some are not prepared for serious reforms until our economy collapses completely. [Brueggmann]  Which reforms would have to be tackled immediately? [Petrov]  Without independent courts, there is no protection of property.  State regulations need to be reduced; newly set-up supervisory authorities need to be dissolved.  Investors need to be convinced that their assets will not be taken by officials.  And the state must stop increasing taxes at regular intervals, thus driving the companies into the shadow economy. [Brueggmann]  Does the takeover of Crimea offer chances for Russian companies? [Petrov]  Russia has enough problems itself.  We do not have the money for investments there.  Many pensioners live in Crimea.   The region lives on huge amounts of subsidies.  Crimea means great expenditures for Russia.  And the threat of harsh sanctions alone has already led to a considerable deterioration of the situation here. [Brueggmann]  Does the annexation of Crimea not support [Russian President] Putin's imperialistic ambitions? [Petrov]  Perhaps for a short while -- but then Crimea will burden us forever. [Brueggmann]  Will the integration of Crimea be followed by the takeover of East Ukraine? [Petrov]  There is only one man who knows that. [Brueggmann]  Why is such a policy so popular in Russia? [Petrov]  The policy is based on a mindset among the people: although we oursleves are getting poorer and poorer, our state is getting stronger and stronger.  Here, the people grow up with the Russian imperialism syndrome.  After all, there is hardly anything else that we can be proud of.  "
"SEVASTOPOL: Vladimir Putin ordered tens of thousands of Russian troops participating in miltiary exercises near Ukraine's border to return to bases last night as US Secretary of State John Kerry flew to Kiev and troops loyal to Moscow fired warning shots at protesting Ukrainian soldiers in the Crimean peninsula. It was unclear if the Russian President's move was an attempt to partly heed the West's call to de-escalate the crisis that threatens to blow up into the biggest test for global diplomacy since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. Hours earlier, US President Barack Obama said Russia was ``on the wrong side of history'' and the Pentagon cancelled all military co-operation with Moscow. Mr Kerry was on his way to Kiev for talks with the new Ukrainian leadership, which has accused Moscow of military invasion in Crimea. The Kremlin, which does not recognise the new Ukrainian leadership, insists it made the move to protect millions of Russians living in the strategically important country. Pro-Russian troops who had taken control of the Belbek air base in the Crimea region fired warning shots into the air yesterday as about 300 Ukrainian soldiers, who previously manned the airfield, demanded their jobs back. About a dozen Russian soldiers stood guarding the airfield and warned the Ukrainians, who were marching unarmed, not to approach. They fired several warning shots and said they would shoot the Ukrainians if they continued to march towards them. The shots were the first since pro-Russian troops -- estimated by Ukrainian authorities to be 16,000 strong -- tightened their grip on the Crimean peninsula over the weekend. There was no fighting elsewhere in Crimea yesterday. A supposed Russian ultimatum for two Ukrainian warships to surrender or be seized passed without action from either side as the ships remained anchored in the Crimean port of Sevastopol. Russian Defence Ministry spokesman Vladimir Anikin said no ultimatum had been issued. Mr Putin's spokesman told Russian news agencies that the President had ordered troops participating in military exercises in western Russia near the Ukraine border to return to their permanent bases. The order was issued almost a week after Russia began massive exercises involving most military units in western Russia, stoking fears that the Kremlin might use the troops to seize territory. Washington's suspension of the post-Cold War co-operation between the US and Russia covers exercises, bilateral meetings, port visits and planning conferences. ``We have, in light of recent events in Ukraine, put on hold all military-to-military engagements between the United States and Russia,'' Pentagon spokesman Rear Admiral John Kirby said. Moscow reiterated its price for ending the crisis: restoration of a deal reached with the opposition less than two weeks ago to form a national unity government in Kiev that represents pro-Russian as well as Ukrainian interests, with new elections to be held by December. Russia is ``on the wrong side of history'' in Ukraine, Mr Obama said, adding that continued military action would be ``a costly proposition for Russia''. Speaking in the Oval Office, Mr Obama said the US was considering economic and diplomatic options that would isolate Russia, and called on congress to work on an aid package for Ukraine. Still, it was unclear what the West could do to make Russia retreat. The clearest weapon at the disposal of the US and the EU appeared to be economic sanctions that would freeze Russian assets and pull the plug on multi-billion-dollar deals with Russia. The EU threatened to freeze visa liberalisation and economic co-operation talks and boycott the June G8 summit in Russia. The economic fallout for Russia was intensely felt. Russia's stockmarket dropped about 10 per cent yesterday and its currency fell to its lowest point against the dollar. Global market reaction to the Russian seizure was furious. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq composite closed sharply down, while oil prices rose on fears that Russia, a major oil exporter, might face sanctions. In European trading, gold rose while the euro and stockmarkets fell. Russian forces swarmed across the Crimean peninsula earlier yesterday, surrounding military bases and taking control of a ferry terminal. Chaotic scenes erupted in Donetsk, where protesters in the stronghold of former president Viktor Yanukovych fought their way into the regional parliament, and Odessa, where a Russian flag was reportedly raised over the local administration, triggering fresh fears about the ability of Ukraine to withstand growing military and economic threats from Moscow. In Odessa, once the largest port in the Soviet Union, an estimated 10,000 people protested against Russian intervention at the weekend. However, a senior official in the new Crimean administration, which Kiev regards as illegal, said that groups in the southern cities of Kherson, Mykolaiv and Odessa were pushing to join the peninsula's bid for independence from the pro-Europe government in Kiev."
"SOCIETY: UKRAINE-FORMIN-MARKIN Ukraine minister plans to appeal to EU over Ukraine pilot trial raise eyebrows in Russia MOSCOW, July 14. /TASS/. Russian Investigative Committee spokesman Vladimir Markin made ironic remarks on Tuesday in comments on plans of Ukrainian Foreign Minister Pavel Klimkin to appeal to the European Union with a request to put pressure on Russia in connection with criminal cases launched against Ukrainian pilot Nadezhda Savchenko and Ukrainian film director Oleg Sentsov, who is accused of preparations for staging terrorist acts in Crimea. ""Integrally with rehabilitating [Soviet-era serial killer Andrei] Chikatilo and revising the results of the Nuremberg Trial. Worthy candidates to the European Union,"" Markin wrote in his Twitter microblog. According to media reports, Klimkin plans to appeal to the EU asking its support in connection with court trials involving two Ukrainian nationals. ""… I plan to send letters to [European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Federica] Mogherini and all foreign ministers of the EU concerning the fate of Savchenko and Sentsov,"" the Ukrainian UNIAN news agency quoted the minister as saying. Russian investigators say that Savchenko, the gunner of a Mi-24 helicopter, joined the notorious Aidar battalion during combat operations in the Lugansk region of eastern Ukraine in June 2014. Noting the position of a filming crew of the Russian State Broadcasting Company and other civilians, she allegedly reported the data to mortar-equipped personnel who fired on the crew and the civilians. As a result, correspondent Igor Kornelyuk and sound engineer Anton Voloshin were killed. Russia""s investigators have collected irrefutable evidence of guilt of Ukrainian citizen Nadezhda Savchenko in the crimes, Markin said on Monday. ""Taking into consideration the collected evidence, the investigators have reclassified the actions of the defendant and now she is set to bear responsibility not as an accomplice but as co-perpetrator of the crime of two or more persons by the dangerous means on motives of hatred for a social group, committed by a group of persons by previous concert,"" Markin said. Savchenko is also charged with an attempt to kill civilians who could have been hurt a result of an adjusted artillery fire. Ukrainian film director Oleg Sentsov is one of those accused in a criminal case opened against members of the Ukrainian saboteur group Right Sector. According to evidence available from secret services, the group had been plotting a series of terrorist attacks - explosions of make-shift bombs on the eve of May 9, 2014 in front of the Eternal Flame memorial and the monument to Lenin in Simferopol, and also arsons of offices of the Russian Community of Crimea non-governmental organization and of the United Russia party in Simferopol on April 14 and 18 2014."
"Steinmeier's return to the Foreign Ministry   Frank Walter Steinmeier is back in his old office. Just like during the last grand coalition between Social Democrats (SPD) and Christian and Social Democrats (CDU/CSU) from 2005 to 2009, he once again heads Germany's Foreign Ministry. And that, the 57-year-old lawyer and politician said, is an ""honor and privilege."" His first official trip abroad took him to France, together with , with whom he reportedly got along with well during his previous time in office. Only rarely did they have disagreements - such as when she received the Dalai Lama at the Chancellery, a step Steinmeier regarded as an unnecessary provocation of the Chinese government. But despite the two being an experienced team, it may very well be that Merkel and Steinmeier may have to reassess their common modus operandi. The glamour is gone Not so powerful any more: the Foreign Ministry in Berlin When Merkel was elected chancellor in 2005, she had little political experience abroad. Consequently, one of her colleagues gave her a globe, which she promptly placed on her desk, for better orientation. Eight years on, she is more than experienced on the international stage, everyone knows her and she knows every maneuver. When it comes to important areas of foreign policy, she will take the lead. It's not unusual for the chancellor to mark out the route for her chief diplomat to embark on. What is unmistakable, however, is how the office of foreign minister has lost much of its former glamour. It used to come with considerable prestige, as well as, usually, the position of deputy chancellor. Today, the Foreign Ministry at times is seen merely as a satellite branch of the Chancellery. In the media it has already mused about the foreign office having lost its clout, passed off for a knock off price at the ""bargain table of coalition talks."" Military constraints For every foreign minister, the basic coordinates are more or less the same: Germany's integration into Europe on one side and its transatlantic partnership on the other. When it comes to foreign policy, it's all about the proven principle of continuity, which Steinmeier, too, mentioned in his inaugural address. However, he added that ""merely conjuring up the well-known"" will not be enough for the future. That's why the chief diplomat would like to see a discussion on the future orientation of Germany's foreign policy. Inaugural words of welcome: Steinmeier (left) and his predecessor Westerwelle It's a discussion that Steinmeier kick-started with voicing one of his own beliefs: Threatening and resorting to military force could not be the ""litmus test for [Germany's] political credibility abroad."" Such behavior would be ignorant to the potentials of prudent diplomacy as well as the particular responsibility Germany bears due to its history. Steinmeier also praised his predecessor, Guido Westerwelle, for maintaining a ""culture of military restraint."" Of friends and partners The between CDU/CSU and SPD comes without any surprises in the field of foreign policy. It specifically mentions France and Poland as particularly important neighbors. Special recognition goes to the United States as ""key to liberty, security and prosperity of all."" As this does not include the liberty of eavesdropping, the coalition partners do expect the US government to restore lost trust and better respect the privacy of German citizens. As the most important future project, the agreement lists the free trade agreement between the EU and the US. Under the new government, relations with Russia remain labeled as a ""partnership of modernization,"" on which both countries would, however, have ""different views."" also comes in high on Steinmeier's agenda. Demonstrators in Ukraine have been pushing for closer ties with Europe for weeks even as the country's president intensifies ties to Russia. Steinmeier has put forward the question whether the country might be overwhelmed ""should it have to choose between Russia and Europe,"" adding that the West had perhaps underestimated Russia's determination in this matter. When it comes to Asia, the coalition agreement sees China and India as ""strategic partners"" with whom economic cooperation should be intensified. In Africa, German support should help states to deal with regional problems on their own, and states of the Maghreb can continue to count on Germany as a ""partner for transformation,"" especially whenever there is ""a notable positive development towards democracy and pluralism in society."" A bundle of foreign policy measures that, in the eyes of the new government, qualifies Germany for a permanent seat on the UN Security Council - when and if the respectively necessary reforms within the United Nations are put in place. Caught between reasons of state and party politics Jetting from one summit to the next: Chancellor Angela Merkel Following his previous term as foreign minister, in 2009 Steinmeier ran against Merkel in federal elections. The result was a shock for his party: The SPD brought home the worst result in its history. It was already during the previous CDU/CSU - SPD government that the Social Democrats complained about having to slave in the engine room of the ""grand coalition steamer,"" while the Christian Democrats would be lolling on the sun deck - a complaint referring to foreign policy and beyond. Germany's foreign policy and politics of European integration might just be the SPD's chance to distinguish itself as Merkel received ample criticism for both her strict stance towards southern European crisis states and her management of the NSA scandal. It remains to be seen whether Steinmeier succeeds in giving these aspects of German foreign policy a signature of his own."

"Text of report by Interfax-Ukraine news agency Kyiv, 5 August: Human rights activists consider illegal the detention of a former Aydar battalion fighter, journalist Yuryy Hukov [aka Yuryy Aseyev tinyurl.com/ojf9jfs], who is accused of robbery in the antiterrorist operation zone. ""Kharkiv Human Rights Group (KHRG) thinks that Yuryy's actions were incorrectly qualified and he should be released,"" KHRG's director Yevhen Zakharov said at the press conference in the Interfax-Ukraine agency on Wednesday [5 August]. According to him, Hukov was detained in Kharkiv on 23 June when he came to police to report a murder as his wife, Anna Samelyuk, who was press-secretary of separatist commander Oleksiy Mozhovyy [Aleksey Mozgovoy], died during the attempt on Mozhovyy's life. [Mozhovyy, Samelyuk and Mozhovyy's bodyguards were killed in an ambush in Luhansk Region on 23 May.] Hukov was accused of robbery because on 4 June 2014 he took part in an attempt to detain a separatism suspect residing in the Luhansk Region town of Troyitske. Aydar battalion commander Serhiy Melnychuk issued an oral instruction to detain this person. Hukov insisted on not detaining him, but one of the fighters took a laptop and a mobile phone from the suspect's flat. Later, these belongings were returned to the owner; however, he filed a complaint with police and Hukov was arrested a year later on the basis of this complaint. Meanwhile, none of the other fighters involved in the incident have been detained. ""Why are volunteer fighters being persecuted for actions committed in the context of complete treason by the Interior Ministry, the Security Service of Ukraine, and others, and one had to have courage to speak out about his political views and to risk his life? The fact that, after a year has passed, they are being persecuted for actions that were considered absolutely normal a year ago makes me think that it is some sort of political campaign,"" Zakharov stressed. He said that Hukov had a conflict with Aydar's commander Melnychuk and openly opposed the lack of discipline in the battalion, torture of prisoners and looting. As a result, he was forced to leave the battalion. ""In some cases prosecution (of Aydar fighters) may be completely reasonable, I assume, because I know what kinds of crimes were committed by Aydar, there were even murders and forced disappearances. But what does Yuryy have to do with this? He was detained when he himself came to them [police] to file a case because his wife was murdered, and they speak about some sort of operational search activities,"" Zakharov said. According to him, Hukov has been working as a journalist with KHRG since 1 September 2014 and his location was known to everyone. The human rights activist did not exclude the possibility that KHRG will apply to the European Court of Human Rights with regards to Hukov's illegal detention."
"Text of report by private Ukrainian news agency UNIAN Mykolayiv, 24 November: In Mykolayiv, the Security Service of Ukraine [SBU] has stopped the operation of a firm which specializes in development of engineering and technological documentation for military vessels of the Russian Navy and Border Guard Service of the FSB [Russia's Federal Security Service].

"Text of report by RIA Dnestr news agency website dniester.ru Moldova's breakaway Dniester region has found itself in an ambiguous position after Moldova signed an association agreement with the EU in late June, Dniester exiled pundit Roman Konoplev has written. In his view, the rebel region, dependent on Russian gas and Ukrainian big business, will have to keep the balance between the interests of Kyiv, Moscow and Chisinau in order to survive. The following is the text of a commentary by Roman Konoplev titled ""Who will feel worse at the end? Reality in Moldova and the Dniester region"" and published on the RIA Dnestr news agency website on 8 July; subheadings have been inserted editorially: The latest events for Moldova and the [breakaway] Dniester region do not hold in store anything positive for the nearest future. The dust has already settled after [Moldovan Prime Minister] Iurie Leanca signed the association agreement with the EU. Now Moldova faces big changes. It will have to get used to economic isolation in the east and loss of a quarter of revenues. It could no longer rely on Russia and its allies. I do not think that Russians will impose any restrictions in the labour market for Moldovan labour force. Like previously, Russia will welcome those wishing to earn on its land. And this flow will not fade out any time soon, but Moldovans from Moldova will challenge Moldovans departing to Russia from Italy and other southern European countries with much fewer jobs. Stable situation in Moldova The political scene of Moldova is rather static - no up and downs are seen. Local authorities hold the grip of the situation, the special service and police nip in the bud any attempts to break the status quo. And, at least at the current stage, the opposition imitates protests hoping to win the political competition. I mean the autumn parliamentary election. At the same time, it is obvious that the non-parliamentary opposition does not have a chance to infiltrate the legislative body in any other way but on the ticket of the Communist Party. In their turn, the Communists have a long-running experience of engulfing all around them and what they will offer the voters is not yet clear. The Communist Party's course is fluctuating and in general corresponds to the nationwide sentiments to a larger scale than to the platform of the pro-European parties. The Communist Party remains most conservative and close to the rural area residents, so the parties of the pro-European alliance will have to take a bigger effort at the election and employ the administrative resource along with finances . Dniester region, Russia playing different games The Dniester region is silently frozen to the spot watching in horror the events in Ukraine. An agreement signed in Moscow between [Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitriy] Rogozin and [Dniester leader Yevgeniy] Shevchuk has no financial ground. At the same time, each of the sides plays its own game. The Dniester authorities desperately show their pro-Russian stance in certain time and in certain place. In return, they get the same zero in the pocket - papers with no particular sense. Like in an anecdote about a locksmith saying: ""Oh, grandma, my arm has gone numb"". ""You, my son, should massage it,"" the old woman says. If someone had forgotten, the locksmith was folding the arm hinting to the wish to drink. But the old woman was showing the finger. This is how the party is now played by Tiraspol and Moscow. There is no mutual trust and it is unlikely to appear any time soon. Dniester elites controlled by Ukrainian business Meanwhile, Tiraspol continues to actively integrate into Ukraine and the scheme is still most comfortable for Kyiv and Chisinau and is extremely disadvantageous for Moscow. Formally, the Dniester region looks like a Russian separatist enclave through which one could reproach [Russian President Vladimir] Putin for attempts to resurrect the USSR. In reality, from the point of appetites of the local elites, the Dniester region is a small bit of Ukraine. And not ""Donetsk-like"" Ukraine, but on the contrary. The Dniester region is still controlled by business structures adjacent to Kyiv. The same structures, ""Dniester-based Akhmetovs"" are the main sponsors of the local political regime. The Dniester business protected itself from political claims on the part of Kyiv demonstrating the highest possible level of loyalty. All the top authority of the region, being dependent on the local business, obstinately ignores all possible pleas for recognition from Donetsk by seemingly the same new formations, the Luhansk people's republic and the Donetsk people's republic. Dniester region's problems The biggest problem of the Dniester region is to win trust with the Kremlin as potential sponsor. Will Moscow continue letting the region use the gas money or will it insist on payments? In the latter case, the budget will be short of 70 per cent of revenues, which will painfully hit the pensioners constituting the majority of the region's population. Problems have already begun. The authorities are forced to cut wages and pensions. The worse is yet to come...[ellipsis as published] Will the Dniester region be able to influence the public and political life of Moldova? Most probably, not. Because there will be no polling stations opened for the Moldovan elections on Dniester territory and private travels of one or two thousand of voters to elections in neighbouring Moldovan villages do not play any particular role. Balance between Moldova, Ukraine, Russia Thus, Moldova has made its mind about its priorities. The authorities try to redirect the goods flows from Russia to Europe. In fact, everyone who could do this have long ago re-directed one's goods as anticipations have been long in the air. Those who failed will make the list of losses on Chisinau's path to the cherished goal - status of an EU member. The Dniester region, in its turn, inclines towards Ukraine. In fact, already today the Dniester region is a fully-fledged part of the modern-day Ukraine, with the only difference that legally it is still a Moldovan region but it financially depends on Russia. If the Dniester region had an access to the sea, the region would have long ago been replaced with the Ukrainian part of Bessarabia. However, since no matching swap is looming, the Dniester elite will have to continue keeping the balance of interests between Chisinau, Kyiv and Moscow in order to stay afloat. Or at least to create an illusion of staying afloat. The question is how long Russia will provide gas assistance to the local budget......[ellipsis as published]"

"Text of report by the website of mass-circulation Russian newspaper Moskovskiy Komsomolets on 4 November [Article by Mikhail Rostovskiy: ""What does Poroshenko really want from Russia?""] I want to make a confession: I have never liked the November holidays. I could not stand the 7 November holiday which back when I was a child had already degenerated into something showy and false. I could not stand the 4 November holiday, which seemed to me an agonizingly artificial attempt to preserve the habitual ""red letter day"" in the calendar in that month. The 2014 November holidays are the first I have assessed at their worth. National Unity Day - why in my eyes has this name suddenly acquired meaning and content? Probably because when the country has no urgent, acute problems threatening the very principles of its existence, ""the people's unity"" does not seem particularly necessary. On the other hand, when these problems do appear, you start to really value unity. And do not go thinking that I have in mind something abstract and high-flown. When the entire country shouts hysterically in a unified spontaneous outburst: ""Glory to our wise chief and leader!"" - that is not unity. It is not what present-day Russia needs. It is the road to the historical impasse from which we extricated ourselves so recently and with such difficulty. Unity is when the country honourably surmounts hard times and resolves the most complex problems without rending itself into pieces. In 1917 and 1991 that did not happen in our country. During the crisis which has begun in 2014 we should remember those historical mistakes - remember them and seek not to repeat them. I am very sorry to have made such a long and melodramatic statement. However, from my viewpoint, hard times have arrived in Russia again - they have arrived and have no intention of leaving. I understand that this thesis of mine is far from uncontentious. But there are various types of political shock. There is the instantaneous shock, when something hard and heavy suddenly hits your head. And there is the slow shock when drops of water drip endlessly onto the top of your head at intervals of a few seconds and there is nothing you can do about it. The Ukrainian crisis - and it is with its arrival in our lives that I connect the return of hard times to Russia - is a shock of the latter category. We are dealing with a horror without end - a nightmare which over the course of time changes only its intensity and its forms. And the latest of these changes occurred while Russians were on vacation and [Ukrainian President] Petro Poroshenko became very angry over the holding of elections in Donbass. The Kiev leader is shouting about the violation of the terms of the September Minsk truce and threatening to revoke the law on the special status of individual regions of Donbass. All juridical conditions are thus created for the resumption of full-scale fighting in Ukraine. Will the fighting be resumed, not juridically but in practice, tomorrow or the day after tomorrow? As I shall explain a little further on, that is far from a fact. But the only thing which remains stable in the situation in Ukraine is its constant instability. The Minsk truce was an enforced tactical step for Poroshenko. Security officials loyal to Kiev had suffered a painful military defeat. Furthermore, the Ukrainian president had to hold parliamentary elections on the country's remaining territory. The elections have now been held. The Ukrainian army has started gradually to recover after its defeat. That does not mean that it will necessarily be launched into battle again in the immediate future. The forces which at the juncture of summer and autumn smashed the units loyal to Kiev have nothing special to lose now. They could repeat the ""lesson"" if the last ""scholastic term"" has not been sufficiently instructive. Poroshenko is aware of that. I think he will keep the ""military card"" up his sleeve and use it only if he is certain of success. But nor will the master of the Kiev presidential palace sit with folded arms waiting for that certainty to appear. For Russians, the phrase ""peace in Ukraine"" means not least the opportunity to do their jobs. Poroshenko will try to deprive us of that opportunity. He sees his mission in constantly maintaining a high degree of tension between us and the West. He is saying: ""I was completely straight with those Russians and separatists, but they are constantly spitting on it!"" That position is profoundly hypocritical. Poroshenko starts really to seek a truce only when they pin him to the wall. But this stance is very practical. It is to Kiev's advantage to portray itself as ""the vanguard of the struggle against Russian imperialism."" The Ukrainian leaders have no possibility of resolving their country's problems themselves, nor do they wish to do so. They want others - the Western states - to do it for them. But how to persuade the thrifty and penny-pinching Westerners to render ""free fraternal aid"" to Kiev? There is only one possibility for doing that - to persuade Westerners that the Poroshenko regime is putting its life on the line to defend the entire civilized world from the terrible threat from the East. The result is a closed circle of mutual exploitation. First Westerners, proceeding from their own selfish and misunderstood interests, brainwashed Ukrainian society and provoked a coup d'etat in Kiev. And now the crafty Ukrainian politicians are pulling the wool over the eyes of their Western counterparts and frightening them with threats of Russian aggression. And you know what perhaps frightens me most in this situation? There is a certain logic in the actions of Poroshenko and [Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy] Yatsenyuk. It is virtually impossible to reincorporate Donbass into Ukraine - the Kiev security services have shed too much blood in attempting to establish a ""civilized European order"" here. But agreeing with Donbass' de facto secession - for any Ukrainian president and premier this is so far something close to inconceivable. So for the foreseeable future Donbass is doomed either to open war or to a scarcely more pleasant state that is neither peace nor war. Russia is also in the position of the doomed. We are doomed to psychological discomfort, to Western pressure, to our economy and sociopolitical lives being hostages to the situation in a neighbouring country. And unless the present direction of movement changes, this state of affairs could last for years. If my prediction comes true, we will unfailingly encounter adverse and even destructive trends in the state's domestic political life. Ukraine in late 2013 and early 2014 was unable to overcome similar trends. The regime descended into a state of revolutionary hysteria and brother fought brother and sister fought sister. Russia cannot afford such a ""luxury."" That is why I have started to prize unity so much - unity not in political views, but unity in equal respect for sanity and in a caring attitude towards the country's fate.

"Text of report by Turkish newspaper Milliyet website on 27 May [Commentary by Sami Kohen: ""Europe to Right... How about Ukraine?""] Some interesting results emerged from two separate elections that will decide Europe's future: The European Parliament elections held in the EU countries for 751 seats revealed an unexpected far-right trend. In Ukraine, one of the new ""oligarchs"" in the country, the billionaire ""Chocolate King"" Petro Poroshenko won the presidential election. Both elections are sending out different signals in the old continent. *** The European Parliament elections delivered shocking results particularly in two countries. In France the Front National (FN) and in United Kingdom UK Independence Party (UKIP) emerged as top parties. Both are far-right, highly nationalist, and anti-EU. In numerous countries ranging from Greece to Austria, from Spain to Denmark radical right-wing parties achieved considerable gains. In the meantime, as seen in Greece, far-left groups, too, made notable progress. Consequently racist, xenophobic, and anti-EU integration politicians' voices will be heard more loudly during the new term of the European Parliament. This is a case for concern for the Turkish people in Europe and Turkey. Even though the center-right and center-left parties suffered losses in the elections, they still hold the majority of seats in the European Parliament. In other words, the fact that far-right parties emerged as winners in some European countries does not alter the fundamental structure of the parliament. However, the emerging tendency is highly dangerous and worrying. From now on the Europeans leaders need to take this new situation more seriously. *** The presidential elections in Ukraine took place at a time when the future of this eastern European country was being anxiously questioned. The country is in the process of disintegration; Kiev lost Crimea to Russia. It lost control of Donetsk and Luhansk regions. The new administration is faced with a very hard task. First of all, it has to end the civil war in eastern Ukraine and bring the region under its authority. For this to happen, it must seek ways to come to an agreement with Russia. This is also necessary for the Ukrainian administration to secure its energy safety and to restore its broken economy. On the other hand, the new government is obliged to fulfill the wishes of the majority of the people for integration with the West and the establishment of EU partnership. Poroshenko, 48, is elected president after easily beating his rivals in the first round and he is in fact in favor of safeguarding the territorial integrity of Ukraine, that is, in favor of crushing the pro-Russian uprising in the eastern regions. He is also for establishing strong ties with the EU. He is making no secret of this in his statements. *** Of course the position Russia is going to take will also decide in which direction Poroshenko will lead Ukraine. An aggressive and expansionist policy will alienate the new Kiev government away from Moscow and push it further toward the West. Russian President Vladimir Putin's statement that he would respect the outcome of the election and that he is ready to meet with Poroshenko shows that Russia's strategy is flexible. The fact that Poroshenko said that he was planning to meet with Putin at least gives an encouraging signal at the outset. Source: Milliyet website, Istanbul, in Turkish 27 May 14"

"Text of report by Ukrainian Donetsk-based news website OstroV on 16 November The former ""minister"" for fuel and energy in the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic [DPR], Oleksiy Hranovskyy [Aleksey Granovskiy], has been arrested by his former brothers-in-arms, his wife Nataliya has reported on Facebook. ""For two days, friends and acquaintances have been on the phone to me all the time with questions about what has happened to Oleksiy. I will no longer keep quiet. My husband really has been detained. He is in a remand center. I am sure everything will be fine. Oleksiy is a decent person. He is not guilty of anything. Thanks to everyone for the support,"" she wrote. Responding to the messages of support for her post, Nataliya said that she did not rule out that the arrests of former DPR activists were of a mass character. ""I don't know who else has been picked up, but I suspect that Donetsk has found its Stalin,"" wrote the wife of a man who played an active role in establishing the current authorities in Donbass. The former head of the press service of the ""DPR foreign ministry"" in Moscow, Darya Mitina, reported that three ""DPR ministers"" had been arrested. She said that none of those arrested had been charged with anything. One of the representatives of the Donetsk community in Moscow and a keen adherent of separatism, Roman Manekin, has said that he considers to be profoundly mistaken ""not to say criminal, the arrest of officials of this level without a public explanation of the grounds for their arrest"". He acknowledged that the DPR currently lacks a criminal procedural code. ""Human rights are absent as a concept. Not just Oleksiy, but any one of us can be arrested at any moment on the most ridiculous grounds: because of intrigues, slanders, or simply the 'antipathy' of the new 'bosses'.

"Text of report in English by Belarusian privately-owned news agency BelaPAN Homel, 1 October: Unidentified individuals scratched the word ""traitor"" on the headstone at the grave of Mikhail Zhyznewski, a young Belarusian man who was killed during clashes between anti-government protesters and riot police in Kiev in January 2014. ""We've reported the attack to the Ukrainian embassy and the police, although we don't believe that the perpetrators will be found,"" Zhyznewski's mother told BelaPAN. ""Vandals have repeatedly tried to destroy the memory of my son. They tore apart yellow-blue ribbons at the grave, the colours of the Ukrainian flag, overturned wreaths and baskets and scattered everything."" The headstone was unveiled on 7 July in a ceremony attended by up to 40 people, including relatives of some other activists killed by police during Ukraine's Euromaydan protests. The red-and-black granite headstone, made by prominent Belarusian sculptor Ales Shaternik, bears a ""Heroes Do Not Die"" inscription and Ukraine's state emblem and Belarus' historically national Pahonya (Pursuit) emblem. Several lines from Eduard Akulin's poem dedicated to Zhyznewski are engraved on the headstone. All those in attendance signed a petition urging Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko to award the Hero of Ukraine title to Zhyznewski posthumously. Mikhail ""Loki"" Zhyznewski left Belarus in 2005 and lived in the city of Bila Tserkva near Kiev.

"Text of the article by Tatyana Stanovaya, director of the Research Department of the Centre for Political Technology, headlined ""The Kremlin between triumph and isolation"" published by Russian political commentary website Politkom.ru on 21 April; subheadings inserted editorially: On 17 April President Vladimir Putin held his latest live Q&A session with the people, in which the main topic was the accession of Crimea and the events in Ukraine. For the domestic Russian political agenda the acquisition of two new components of the federation was undoubtedly a triumphant event breathing new life into the Vladimir Putin regime. But the limited nature of the ""triumph"" and the impasse in materialization of the previous policy of the positioning of Russia in the world born in connection with the Ukrainian processes are a paradox of the present political situation. Explaining new reality A substantial part of the phone-in was devoted to Russia's actions against Ukraine. Following the annexation of Crimea, an unprecedented blow has been struck at Russia's international reputation: the country found itself on its own in the UN Security Council (China having abstained), in the Western community the viewpoint that Crimea was annexed through occupation of the peninsula is predominant, and the disturbances in Eastern Ukraine have been stage-managed from the Kremlin with a view to achieving the separation of the region and its incorporation in the Russian Federation with the high risk of military aggression. The Western press is readily quoting the alleged words of German Chancellor Angela Merkel to the effect that Putin has lost touch with reality, and new sanctions are being discussed. Whence arise the natural questions: how will the Crimean incident impact Russia's long-term foreign and domestic policy? Are we talking about a reconsideration of foreign-policy priorities? Is it possible to speak of an abrupt turnabout of Russia towards execution of an ambitious imperial project ""a la USSR""? Putin had to explain himself here under conditions of the contrast between the tremendous support within the country and the critically low trust of what he says on the part of the world community: after all, he had said at the start of March that there would be no annexation of Crimea. On the whole, the phone-in provides answers to the questions asked, with the correction merely that none of them is conclusive even in the short term. Of the three models of relations with the West, the first is now absolutely impossible, the second is dubious from the perspective of practicability, and the third is attended by considerable risk. Model No 1 The first model, judging by what the president had to say, preserves the official priority, but, in actual fact, is wholly in the sphere of rhetoric. This is the West's recognition of Russia's dominance on the post-Soviet territory and also its veto of the adoption of key world-level decisions. Russia has not in the past 15 years been about, and, specially, is not now about, to draw closer to the West in terms of values. In the 1990s this process was practically suspended (particularly following the war in Yugoslavia in 1999), and the Medvedev ""reset"", remaining a project that was ""from the top"" and non-consensus for the power elite, was able to alter little. It is this format of relations that Putin attempted to set relations with the West from day one of his presidency. It is clear here that this model has in 14 years practically lost touch with reality: the geopolitical weakness of Russia and the reluctance of the West to recognize Moscow's ""traditional area of influence"" in the near abroad resulted in the most profound disenchantment of the Kremlin and the growth of authoritarian trends within the country. A new spiral of far more destructive disenchantment, on both sides now, has come about in the current period. Whereas earlier, despite all the rhetoric of distrust and ""cold peace"", Russia had persons to rely on in the West (the former leaders of Germany, France, and Italy may be recalled - although personal contacts could not impart stability to the relations if they were not linked with institutional and value rapprochement), now Russia has practically no sympathisers in the Western elite (provided we do not count the cautious appeals of Western business connected with the Russian economy to the political authorities requesting that they avoid a destructive severance of relations with Moscow). It is no accident that during the Q&A Putin touched on two subjects which were to have confirmed Russia's ""Europeanism"", but which, in actual fact, go back to Soviet times. The first of these subjects is the single-space Europe ""from Lisbon to Vladivostok"". This concerns a single security space (the old idea of common missile defences), a common economic space, visa-free procedures, the reformatting of NATO and a joint fight together with the West against common threats from ""third parties,"" about which Putin spoke also, and joint ""responsibility"" for any situations of instability which arise on territories of mutual interests (a solution of Ukraine's gas problem is a topical example). But without value rapprochement and, consequently, Russia's gradual integration in institutional structures of Europe, such an approach remains rhetorical. Rapprochement has not evoked enthusiasm in the Russian authorities owing to the sense of Russia's civilizational ""self-sufficiency"" and reluctance to stand on the same footing as Luxembourg or Estonia. The second subject is the direct appeal, bypassing the elite, to the European peoples (Putin went this route for the first time during his 17 March message). Such practice was actively employed in the period of the cold war, but was ineffective in the attempts to influence the adoption of foreign-policy decisions (to prevent the deployment of American missiles in West Europe in the first half of the 1980s, for example). But now Western society, in respect to which Russian propaganda remains impotent, is set against Putin's actions, effectually only the extreme left and extreme right politicians (from the Left in Germany to the Front National in France) are in sympathy with Russia, which is actively promoted in Russia's public space. Moscow has found itself almost entirely on its own, not counting the silent position of China (which merited during the Q&A only the highest evaluations of the ""unprecedented high level of relations""). Even Belarusian President Alyaksandr Lukashenka acknowledged the legitimacy of the Ukrainian authorities and termed dangerous the idea of the federalization of Ukraine. Russia under Putin finds itself in such a position in the world arena for the first time. Model No 2 The second model, which was de facto materialized in the years of the ""chill"" in the relations of Russia and the West (not counting the brief ""reset"" period), has been expressed in the maintenance of cool, but not confrontational, relations. In the idling of the dialogue, that is on the core subjects (meaning the widest range of issues, from the promotion of Gazprom's energy projects in the EU through the late ""reset"" period) with certain ""points of contact"" (on questions of the cooperation of Russia and the West in Afghanistan, for example). But Russia will hardly manage to remain part of this inertial model either: following the annexation of Crimea, it is no longer considered a partner for the discussion of world problems. Russia has to date found itself in a situation of operating (and, we cannot rule, upcoming) sanctions, restricted rights in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, loss of place in the G8, frozen contacts with NATO, and so forth. Judging by the Putin Q&A, the Russian leader is prepared to put up with the loss, but he himself will not provoke a severance of relations. But Crimea was the point of bifurcation because Russia, from the perspective of the West, breached the base rules of international law (based on a value approach included) and showed itself to be an unpredictable country by analogy with the USSR. The refusal to intensify the conflict with the West and the aspiration to minimize the damage could afford an opportunity for a future ""defrosting"" of relations with the United States and the EU countries, but will not alter the negative psychological perception of the Russian authorities, which will influence actual decision-making in the economy and policy. A return to this model (albeit under new, considerably more negative, conditions) is the best that Russia might expect in the event of a gradual lowering of the escalation around Ukraine (provided that Russia does not demonstrate its assertive role in destabilizing processes within Ukraine). Putin is clearly banking on a gradual way out of the crisis, letting it clearly be known that Russia will not be annexing new territories and that the Crimea situation was not part of a plan hatched in advance, it is a historically exclusive, unforeseen situation. Russia's demands of Ukraine have been emphasized quite distinctly also: direct gubernatorial elections and neutral status. Until this is achieved, Moscow is prepared to employ its ""gas weapon"" at full force and also to defend the interests of Russian-speakers in Ukraine itself (which, on the other hand, looks like an instrument of destabilization of the situation and support for the separatists). Nonetheless, judging by the president's remarks, Moscow will not be going beyond support for those who are championing the idea of a referendum, unless there is a chaotic situation and bloodshed, of course. Model No 3 The third model signifies isolation in foreign policy and the formation of an authoritarian regime within the country. It would appear that this model is undesirable for Putin, but it has serious domestic political support from the ""hawks"" and ""custodians"". There are two powerful factors, catalysts of movement in this direction. The first is the policy of the West. Vladimir Putin is probably prepared to wait, to ""invest"" in the restoration of relations, but not for too long. A further growth of tension, an expansion of sanctions, a winding up of dialogue - all this would inevitably result in an increase in anti-West rhetoric within the country, a severance of the ties of the Russian elite to Western institutions, a withdrawal of assets, and so forth. The second factor is the internal political assertiveness of the ""guardians"", a growth of a new conservative wave, an abrupt weakening of the liberals (who remain within the regime only in technical positions), and promotion of the proposition ""Russia is not Europe"" with all the ensuing ideological cliches and ""conservative set"" of values (traditions, family, patriotism, religion, spiritual ties, and so forth). It is indicative that big arguments were evoked by the document ""Essentials of national policy in the field of culture"" prepared by the Ministry of Culture, which propounds in unabashedly propaganda tones the thought of a special civilizational code of the Russian nation, whose values are openly contrasted with European values. Putin himself here is not publicly in a hurry to make common cause with such views but nor is he in any hurry to seriously curb them either, seeing them as a potential resource for the mobilization of society around his figure and a consolidation of the institutions of power, and also for the minimization of political and ideological competition. As has frequently been the case in the past, he aspires to find a middle way - but now with a clear tilt towards ""anti-Westernism"". On the one hand, the president observed that ""the particular features of Russia are not fundamentally, profoundly different from European values. We are all people of one civilization."" On the other, the final question, which he picked out himself, was on the subject of national patriotism: ""How do Russians differ from other peoples of the world?"" Putin's answer came down to two key propositions: Russianness means a generous heart and a readiness to die for the fatherland. ""It is here that our patriotism is deeply rooted,"" ""whence also the heroism at the time of military conflicts and wars and even self-sacrifice. Whence the feeling of fellowship and our family values,"" Putin said, adding that he does not want to offend the representatives of other peoples, ""they have their advantages."" These propositions clearly do not jibe with each other but they demonstrate the actual situation, when an understanding of the country's dependence on world markets and the weakness of the Russian economy, which is stagnating with an inauspicious outlook, live side by side with the desire to emphasize one's ""selfness"" and a perception of the West as a threat, which needs to be opposed to the utmost on all fronts. National patriotism (Russian patriotism) has as of late been acquiring the features no longer just of an instrumentally spurred trend but of an independent phenomenon, whose representatives de facto hold fast the social and political agenda in the mass media and set the vector of change of Russian legislation (it is at times now becoming hard to know what's the initiative of the Kremlin, and what of the ""custodians"" here). Dealing with ""liberals"" It is important to talk separately about the practical leaching from the public discourse of the liberal agenda, which remains of current interest exclusively for the opposition news media and bloggers. ""Liberals"" on the phone-in were represented by Kommersant FM radio (Andrey Norkin), the public figure Irina Khakamada, and Irina Prokhorova, chairman of the Civil Platform party. Of these, only Prokhorova put a question that is of current interest for liberals: on culture having been reduced to a ""servant of ideology"", on the division in society against the background of Russia's actions in regard to Crimea. Putin's answer clearly shows the significant decline even as part of rhetoric in the value of democratic standards: the president says that critics of power ""are not being snatched, jailed, or sent away anywhere, to prison camps, as was the case in 1937"". The plank of the ""permissible"" has been lowered to the level of 1937 - the lowest point reflecting a purely totalitarian regime. Norkin asked for support for patriotic character building via cadet education. Khakamada, announced as the representative of the minority which did not support the annexation of Crimea, praised Putin for a ""brilliant operation"" and spoke of the need for the ""Russian self-identification"" of the peninsula and the federalization of Ukraine - precisely what the Kremlin is talking about. The sole good news for the liberal community was the president's positive comment on the Dozhd television channel (""an interesting channel with a good young team"") - Putin promised to spare it problems, having paternally given a little scolding for a ""mistake"" on the air (meaning the poll on the blockade of Leningrad, after which the channel's problems began). Now much will depend on Putin's readiness to keep his promise (after all, he once spoke of having no intention of bankrupting Yukos). Over the weekend Khakamada spoke on several television channels, as a matter of fact -guardedly, but critically here. It is the authorities' desire, apparently, not to take anti-liberalism to extremes (but it is unclear to what extent this will succeed with regard to the assertiveness of the ""anti-Westerners,"" who believe that they now have an opportunity to smash their opponents). Only Konstantin Remchukov, chief editor of Nezavisimaya Gazeta, who has always been a moderate figure, was a consistent liberal in the debate. But he did not get a conversation going with Putin. In response to the question whether ""the Putin system will weigh down on everyone, relying on the patriotic post-Crimea majority"", the president preferred to ignore the problem, pointing out that he personally considers himself ""very democratic"". The Q&A showed that Vladimir Putin is in a situation where further steps are dependent on the West's readiness to lower the temperature. Putin is prepared for a certain time (probably not too long) to occupy a wait-and-see position, not acting to cause a deterioration in the situation, ignoring the sanctions, and counting on a change in the situation subsequently. It is obvious that Putin is not prepared for isolation and is in no hurry to compensate for the severance of relations with the West with a build-up of contacts in the East (the idea of the formation of a military-political bloc with China, which is clearly unrealistic, but popular among Russian ""patriots,"" has been rejected) but handing the initiative to external factors makes this position of Russia's vulnerable. Ukraine, in which Russia is already heavily involved, will remain a source of new problems. A continuation of the destabilization and escalation of the conflict would throw Russia back to the worst scenario of the development of its foreign and domestic policy.

"The camouflage cloth is sliding from the new war machine of Russia, which for a long time has been hiding the weapons that the Kremlin will be rattling in the near future. Officials responsible for our country's information security warn that an important part of this machine has been planted in the foundations of Lithuania, too. [Passage omitted on the Russian war in Georgia and on the new type war that Russia is waging in Ukraine today]. Fuelling Discord in Lithuania Nonconventional war is not a new war strategy, but this is the first time when Russia is using this method so openly. One can say that the Kremlin has revealed its cards. Finally it has become clear how Russia would use propaganda and the fifth column, if it directed its aim at the Baltic states. For example, a month ago in Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia unofficial polls were conducted, which were organized by Russia. The goal of those polls was to learn about the view of citizens towards the situation in Ukraine and on the possibility of certain regions of the Baltic states to split off. Valdis Zatlers, the head of the National Security Committee of the Latvian Saeima, says that the Russians were probing public opinion, the media environment, and were conducting polls of the people crossing the border. Such actions by Moscow worry defense analysts. After all, the war doctrine principles of Russia, which were used in the cities of east Ukraine, have been applied in the Baltic states for a few years now, too. First, a wide scale information war is already being conducted against our states, and this is the preparatory stage of fueling revolts. Russia is also using modern propaganda, psychological operations, and soft power. Another step is sparking a huge civil confrontation. Using the fifth column -- people who are favorable towards the regime of the Kremlin -- one can create animosity among citizens. For example, recently in Lithuania public movements have been created. Those movements do not appear to have a political nature, but the values that they are defending surprisingly coincide with the policies of Moscow. Most often they speak openly against the EU, the United States, human rights, and believe in the social conservatism ideas, created by the Kremlin. These people fiercely protest against Lithuania's energy, economic, and foreign policy projects that are not useful to Russia. Such groups of citizens can be used to fuel discord in the Lithuanian society. This does not mean that these people will resort to extreme actions. The opposite can actually occur -- their ideas that are very radical and useful to Russia can work as a provocation, prompting conscientious citizens to take decisive action. It is interesting to note that such public movements started to spring up in Lithuania a few years ago, when the Kremlin started applying the new technology of the information war. One of them is acting not via the media, but via citizen groups, instilling thinking schemes that are useful to Russia. ""This is a worrisome tendency, which shows that Russia has changed. We also must change our stance on defense. We must understand that today aggression can come not via external borders, but from inside the country,"" an analyst who monitors the Lithuanian information sphere said. "
"The eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv on Tuesday rejected all demands by pro-Russian militants, who continued to protest outside the government offices which they have seized twice this week. Scores of cleaners swarmed the corridors of the imposing state government headquarters after the protesters were thrown out for a second time, having trashed and torched several offices overnight Monday. Speaking to AFP from his office in the freshly liberated building, Deputy Governor Vasiliy Khoma said any attempt at negotiations had broken down as the protesters' demands were ""clearly unfeasible, impossible and unlawful"". The protesters in the Russian speaking city just 40 kilometres (25 miles) from the border with Russia, have joined other eastern Ukrainian cities in demanding a referendum for more autonomy from the Western leaning government in Kiev. ""Everyone knows... that the regional council doesn't have the power to take such a decision. It's not something that according to Ukrainian law on local self-government, can be decided by such a body,"" said Khoma. He said the militants had decided in the hallways of the administration building to ""create a Kharkiv republic"", following the lead of their counterparts in the city of Donetsk who remain in control of the government headquarters there. ""Deputies were elected and there were about 500 of them but do you think that these people can represent the interests of three million people in the Kharkiv region?"" said Khoma. Over three days, a standoff outside the building has taken on a pattern of undulating scuffles between riot police and a ragtag group of pro-Russians including hundreds of club-wielding youths and angry old ladies. By day the protesters chant ""Russia, Russia"" and ""Re-fe-ren-dum"" as hundreds of riot police form a blockade around the building. As night falls the increasingly agitated militants push their way into the building with little resistance from the police. By the time dawn breaks, the police have once again ejected the protesters. ""With each attack it became more severe, with protesters using weapons like fireworks and sound grenades,"" Khoma said of the escalation on Monday night. ""Around midnight they assaulted again and used fairly simple tactics to set fire to rooms inside the building. Noxious smoke began to fill the building and the police couldn't stay there any more."" When police cleared the building on Tuesday morning, they found piles of paving stones hoarded to use as weapons, as well as large stocks of food. According to Khoma it was a ""well organised attack"". The pro-Russian protesters remained outside the building on Kharkiv's Freedom Square, vowing fresh ""mobilisation"". Armed security forces, clad in black and wearing balaclavas, appeared outside the building on Tuesday to reinforce police who have been accused of co-operating with the protesters. Interior Minister Arsen Avakov told reporters some 30 percent of police would be let go. rl-fb/dh"
"The EU said Wednesday that controversial Ukraine laws offering pro-Russian rebels an amnesty and special status in the conflict-torn east of the country were important steps toward a peaceful solution. The self-rule and amnesty laws were agreed in a peace plan signed in Minsk by both Kiev and Moscow earlier this month which, despite ceasefire violations, appears to be the best bet to end the five-month conflict. ""Our point of view is that Ukraine has delivered on the Minsk agreement,"" European Union foreign affairs spokeswoman Maja Kojicancic said. ""The amnesty and regional status (laws) are important steps toward finding a sustainable political solution,"" Kojicancic said. A statement issued later by the EU's foreign affairs arm repeated these remarks but added that Brussels expected Russia and the rebels to live up to their commitments in the Minsk accord. ""We expect that Russia and the separatists will reciprocate soon by implementing the pending points of the 12-point Minsk agreement,"" the statement said. These covered ""in particular, withdrawal of illegal armed groups, military equipment and fighters and mercenaries from Ukraine, as well as viable control of the Russian-Ukrainian border, to be monitored by the OSCE,"" it said. The pro-Russian rebels have given Ukraine's measures a cautious welcome but also insisted again that they will not stop fighting for independence from Kiev. Ukraine lawmakers unanimously approved the ""special status"" law on Tuesday just moments before they ratified a landmark pact with the EU which highlighted Ukraine's decisive turn away from Russia's sphere of influence. President Petro Poroshenko said the moves should bring peace to the east where Kiev would have to come to ""an understanding with these (rebel) leaders, bringing people peace, calm and harmony."" Some critics, however, say the measures go too far in accommodating Russia and the pro-Moscow rebels and could risk a permanent division of Ukraine. The conflict has left some 2,900 people dead so far while at least 600,000 have been forced to flee their homes across the east, the industrial heart of the country which has been badly damaged in the fighting, according to UN figures. bmm/lc/gj"

Some 93 days are left for the election of a new president. This time will pass rapidly! The candidate of the AKP [ruling Justice and Development Party] seems to be clear... Deputy heads of the party, the ministers and MPS all say: Tayyip Erdogan. But who will be the candidate from the opposition? Contrary to the AKP's candidate, the single presidential candidate from the opposition should not divide the country, should not polarize the country by being separatist!

They expect him/her to be more flexible, more tolerant and to embrace society. The constitution also says that the president represents the unity of the nation. It would not be correct to project the 30 March [local] election results on the presidential election. One should consider the presidential election in its own circumstances. Apparently, the opposition will continue its bid to field a single candidate. However, it does not seem easy for them to agree.""

The economic sanctions campaign of the West makes Russia think to a certain extent. Moscow is afraid of being isolated. The uprising in East Ukraine has given both Kiev- and the West- the message: pro-Russian activists cannot be eliminated. It is Putin, who escalates and calms down tensions.

"The upheaval of the war in Ukraine, Latvia's presidency of the Council of the European Union, the approach of March 16, the endless ""professional Russian comrades"" -- Latvia's security services have no shortage of work at this time. The new commander of the Security Police [DP], Normunds Mezviets, discussed these and other issues in an interview conducted by Latvijas Avize journalists Voldemars Krustins, Maris Antonevics and Girts Zvirbulis. [Krustins] Last November, the chairman of the Saeima [Parliament] Defense, Interior Affairs and Anti-Corruption Commission, made critical statements in an interview with our newspaper about the idea that security institutions had been ""living in a box."" Has anything changed in the institution that you represent, at least? [Mezviets] When I took over the job, I stressed the fact that one of my priorities will be public information. I can be a bit self-critical in admitting that this was not our priority in the past. We stuck to the idea that the work of national security institutions is discreet. We informed top officials about our work in accordance with the law, but I personally think that in the 21 st century, society has the right to be informed, too. It is also in our interests to ensure that people are aware of the specifics of our work. Perhaps you have noticed that we have been much more active with public communications since I took over the command of the Security Police. We issue various news releases about our activities. We offer our views and opinions about various security threats. We are working on a new homepage and, of course, we publish our annual report in Latvia and English. There are also other hopes. Style of Work [Krustins] Each boss has a somewhat different working style. My impression was that when General Reiniks ran the DP, the focus was more on identifying violations of the law, conducting investigations and perhaps implementing sanctions against the violators. Should the DP not work more on preventive methods? [Mezviets] I fully agree. I admit that sometimes our work has been mostly focused on obtaining the information to which you referred. That is the function of the special services -- to obtain information, analyze it, and inform officials ab out possible threats. It is also our job to neutralize risks against national security. We have always done that even if the public has not noticed. We are, however, working more on preventive activities, because the national security situation has changed fundamentally. We can no longer afford just to collect information. We ourselves must active prevent risks under the framework of the law. [Krustins] Does that mean an internal reorganization of the DP? [Mezviets] Each commander comes with his own thinking and team. I do not want to deny that I have different ideas than was the case in the past. [Krustins] Should you not do more research work? [Mezviets] One of our priorities is to develop our analytical branch, and we are working hard on this. It is one thing to obtain information, but another thing to decode and analyze it. This has to do with our capacity and the quality of our personnel. You must understand that the DP is not a police institution in the sense of combating crime. We work in different areas to find very different risks against security -- political, foreign policy, economic, financial risks, and so on. That is why we need a great many experts from various areas -- lawyers, political scientists, financiers, economists, theologians and IT specialists. In this labor market, we compete with the public and private sector, but because the Saeima granted us additional funding at the beginning of this year, we can develop, set up new branches and hire more people. Hybrid War [Krustins] Recently there have been lots of people in our country who have been talking about the idea of a hybrid war, but practical and explanatory aspects of this, it seems to me, have been left behind. [Mezviets] We are thinking about all of these issues, and all of these matters are being resolved. Please believe me when I say that very intensive work is being done. Still, that is all classified information, and decisions are made in narrow formats. We are preparing the necessary documents, plans, and everything else. It is not odd that the public is not informed extensively about these matters. That is the case in any country. [Zvirbulis] While you look at narrow formats, signs of the hybrid war can be found on Internet comments, for instance. What information do you have about Internet provocateurs or the so-called trolls? Is there evidence that their activities are being financed from Russia? [Mezviets] The activities of the ""trolls"" are not a phenomenon that occurs only in Latvia. Comparable activities have basically been identified in all Western countries. The activities of the ""trolls"" have increased in the context of the Ukrainian crisis. There is public information from people who have been involved in these activities and have revealed the fact that Russia is organizing these activities. We have identified ""trolls"" who are active on the Internet in Latvia. This is one of our priorities, but I am afraid that I cannot talk about this issue in details. Role of Others [Krustins] ""Activists"" such as Gilmans, Guscins, Gaponenko and others probably do not work hard for free, and their work also demands financing. Perhaps they do not receive wages as such, but they are supported in one way or another. At the end of the day, how else would they attend various events in Moscow, Tallinn and other foreign countries. [Antonevics] You have talked publicly about 100 organizations that support Russia's compatriot policy and are, in some cases, financed from Moscow. What is the problem in preventing this inflow of money? Perhaps amendments to the law are necessary? [Mezviets] I agree. Finances decide everything. That is true for anti-state organizations, espionage services and organized crime. If there is no financing, then there are no activities. Russia's compatriot policy in Latvia is largely based on so-called professional compatriots who basically earn a living for themselves with such activities. They receive financing from various Russian funds, supposedly for research, public activities, production of films, writing of books and travel to international conferences. They compete fairly actively amongst themselves and push and shove one another to access those funds. I must admit that the financing of associations is not particularly regulated at this time, and there are no limitations on their ability to receive financing. The current system is one in which associations must file annual reports about what they have done with their money, but this reporting is very generalized. Theoretically, associations have to state donations from foreign legal entities and non-residents, but there are various ways of evading this requirement. For instance, all donations can be registered as anonymous ones. What is more, it is not even necessary to hide foreign financing, because the official receipt of such resources does not hinder the ability of associations to become involved in campaigns and activities that are presented as the activities of the civil society. This creates a situation in which other countries can directly and indirectly influence political processes in Latvia, thus destroying the country's independence, territorial integrity and constitutional order in the long term. I will also say that in their financial reports, associations do not monetize services that they have received or volunteer work that has been done, paid interviews and articles as well as other types of informative support. We have prepared lots of proposals on how to limit such financing with the help of the law, but we have not received support from other institutions. We tried to deal with this issue even before the crisis in Ukraine, but others viewed us with suspicions -- the main thing, after all, is human rights. Ours is a liberal democracy, and we cannot ban organizations from receiving foreign financing. Now this understanding is finally changing at government institutions. [Antonevics] The so-called Moscow House in Riga has become something of a headquarters for various pro-Kremlin activities in Latvia. Was it not a mistake to give that building to them? [Mezviets] I do not think that it has influenced much of anything. These people and organizations would find venues for their activities very easily with the help of friendly local governments or businesspeople. Propaganda [Krustins] Military specialists and government officials have loudly claimed that wars today focus first and foremost on people's minds. Sadly, our historians, political scientists and other scholars have reacted lazily to obviously pointless claims from pro-Kremlin activists. Does your work include the organization of appropriate counter-propaganda? [Mezviets] One thing that we do is track the publication of various more or less anti-state books that correspond to the Kremlin's narratives about the supposed oppression of ethnic minorities in Latvia, glorification of the Soviet era, or mudslinging against the periods of independence. We would like our intellectuals and representatives of the academic environment to be more active in opposing Russian propaganda. At the same time, however, I understand that historians, political scientists, international law specialists and other scholars who have self-respect believe that it is beneath their professional honor to involve themselves in a debate about nightmarish claims such as that there was no occupation, that there was no Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, or that there were no Soviet repressions. Still, there are some cases in which this should be done. Alternative views really are important, and that would mean unmasking the true goals of these propaganda objects. We have noticed that as soon as someone publicly talks about the true goals of those who spread the Kremlin's propaganda they become extremely nervous and feel uncomfortable. Russia is an enormous country with enormous resources, and it has devoted astonishing financial resources for propaganda. True this financing has shrunk in the recent past because of the sanctions. Our ability to be active in countering this propaganda is rather limited. There are very different subjects that flood Russia's propaganda into our country, including pure informative operations by special services, supposedly academic research studies, the activities of non-governmental organizations, and diplomats. If we want to neutralize this, then Latvia's government must oppose the process at an equally integrated and inter-institutional way. I am glad that the government's attitude is changing and that there is an increasing understanding that this problem is not just the responsibility of three security services -- the DP, SAB [Bureau to Protect the Constitution], and Military Espionage and Security Service -- but also ministries, scholars and the media. [Krustins] Well, if it is not possible to respond to Moscow's propaganda at an equal level, then perhaps you could limit the fingers of Moscow's hand that publish anti-state books right here in Latvia and publish hostile comments in the local Russian language press? [Mezviets] We live in a democratic country in which much attention is focused on the freedom of the press and the freedom of speech. At the same time, however, there has recently been an increasing understanding of the fact that freedom of speech must be in line with national security interests. Otherwise we can find ourselves in a situation in which Latvia's political resources are controlled by people with very different ideas about this issue, and then we will be the ones who are or are not allowed to publish books. I will also say that the authors of these books and comments are well-educated, and they understand the legal consequences of any violations that they commit. That is why they have learned to formulate their views so that they are obviously hostile or anti-state, but it would be hard to prove that in legal terms. I must also remind you that the DP engages in pre-trial investigations. We hand our work over to the Prosecutor-General's Office to launch criminal investigations, but only the court can convict a person. I would add that our partnership with the Prosecutor-General's Office is very constructive. Spies [Krustins] One of our readers asked me to ask you how it is that the Lithuanians and Estonians catch spies, while no spy has been found in Latvia for many years. Surely it is not the case that there are no spies in our country. [Mezviets] Anti-espionage is a broad concept, you see. Arrests, detentions and procedural investigations are just one way in neutralizing the activities of foreign espionage agents. It is not the only way. [Zvirbulis] What about those Latvian residents who have gone to Eastern Ukraine to support the Donbas terrorists? The Saeima has criminalized participation in foreign wars, there are serious punishments, but if we are to believe news from the Internet, then the number of Latvian residents in the Donbas is increasing. [Mezviets] We are tracking the situation, and each week we obtain and check out information about people who may have traveled to the Donbas or are preparing to do so. We investigate every claim, and often it proves that the information is false. Representatives of the public actively inform us -- not just Latvians, but also Russians and people of other nationalities. One of the mechanisms for encouraging people to go to the Donbas is the network of National Bolsheviks in Russia, and former Barkashovites are also active in this regard. They have military units in the Donbas that basically consist only of the present or former activists of those organizations. There are people who try to go there with the help of local acquaintances, while others just pick up sticks and move to the Donbas. March 16 [Zvirbulis] In advance of March 16 in recent years, there have been calls for journalists to ignore events related to the commemoration of the Latvian Legion in the hope that in that case, provocateurs will also lose interest in this issue. Do you think that such a boycott would improve the security situation? [Mezviets] I do not think that a boycott would resolve much of anything. Even if your journalists were to ignore the event, Russia would certainly reflect it and use its resources to do the same in our own informative arena. I can agree, however, that the attitude of journalists toward this date could have been more constructive and less emotional. The situation has been fine in recent years, and journalists who understand the seriousness of the situation try to avoid sensations or to foment unnecessary passions. Five or six years ago, these events were reflected with much more intensive hysteria. [Antonevics] Latvijas Avize has informed the DP about threats that Ilarions Girss has made against our newspaper. [Mezviets] We have received your submission and added it to our criminal file on Girss. [Zvirbulis] Representatives of the DP have regularly complained at the Saeima that they lack resources to investigate those who receive residence permits. What can you learn about them? I doubt whether Russia's espionage services are in any big hurry in providing you with information about Russian citizens who want to receive a residence permit in Latvia. [Mezviets] Analysis of a person's profile allows us to see rather clearly in which risk group he or she should be included. We do not even need the help of Russia's special services. This is specifically an area in which the government has granted us additional financing. What is more, the number of seekers of residence permits from Russia has shrunk in recent times, both because the threshold of the cost of real estate that is bought so as to receive a residence permit has been increased and because of economic instability in Russia itself. [Zvirbulis] How often do you have to reject the request of an individual for a residence permit for security reasons? Does the Citizenship and Migration Board take your conclusions into account? [Mezviets] As of today, we have recommended the denial of a residence permit for 30 people. Our views are not compulsory for the Citizenship and Migration Board, but they are taken into account. [Zvirbulis] You recently arrested a person who was collecting petition signatures in support of Latvia joining Russia. It is most likely that he or his lawyers will claim that this was just a joke, that you are violating the freedom of speech, and so on. Before someone else decides to make similar ""jokes,"" please explain where the line in the sand is between freedom of speech and a violation of the law? [Mezviets] It is completely clear that even in a democratic country where freedom of speech prevails, there can be no calls for the destruction of the country's territorial integrity. Calls for our country to merge with another with not remain unpunished, and anonymity will not be of any help here. The person whom you mentioned tried to hide his tracks on the Internet, but we found him and detained him."
"TORONTO, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Russia is calling on the United Nations Security Council to help protect civilian jets from anti-aircraft weapons after the downing of a Malaysian airliner in Ukraine last year. The Russian position comes after it dismissed proposals by the U.N.'s aviation body, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), as ""superficial."" The Security Council is much more powerful than Montreal-based ICAO, a specialized agency that sets safety standards for global aviation. Its guidelines typically become regulatory requirements in its 191 member states. ICAO needs ""a mechanism of cooperation with the U.N. Security Council, state military authorities and military-political unions in order to timely detect potential threats to civil aviation flight safety and to respond to these threats,"" said Russia's Interstate Aviation Committee, which oversees civil aviation in the former Soviet Union. Russia outlined its stance in documents released ahead of a major U.N. air safety conference in Montreal on Feb. 2-5. ICAO's proposal, which is on next week's agenda, has gotten U.S. backing. ICAO has been under pressure to come up with new systems to protect aircraft from risks in conflict zones after Malaysia Airlines MH17, flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, was shot down in Ukraine last July, killing all 298 people on board. The incident occurred during fighting between Ukraine and pro-Russian separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine. The United States said the plane was hit with a ground-to-air missile by rebels. Russia says a Ukrainian military aircraft downed it. Last week, Reuters reported that the United States would back an ICAO proposal on flight safety over conflict zones, which would test a central website where states and agencies could publish public warnings about conflict zones. Russia has not commented on that proposal, but in October the country lashed out in a paper obtained by Reuters, calling ICAO's ongoing work on conflict zones ""superficial"" and outside its mandate. Russia is in an unusual position at ICAO. Blamed by the West for supplying rebels with anti-aircraft missiles, a charge it denies, it must still work closely with Ukraine and other powers at ICAO to keep the global aviation system running smoothly.

"Ukraine President Viktor Yanukovych has told European Commission head Jose Manuel Barroso he does not plan to introduce a state of emergency to curb violent protests in Kiev, the Commission said Thursday. The two men talked by telephone and the president ""reassured Barroso that it was not foreseen to install a state of emergency in Ukraine,"" Commission spokesman Olivier Bailly said. For his part, Barroso urged Yanukovych ""to engage in dialogue at the highest level"" ahead of more talks later Thursday with opposition leaders in Kiev. Amid speculation that the EU was considering possible sanctions against Ukraine, Bailly said Brussels for the time being wanted to ""give a political dialogue every chance"". ""We want to see the situation calm down, the ending of violence against peaceful demonstrators and journalists,"" Bailly said. The EU ""wanted to help"" the Ukrainian dialogue, he said, with EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele due to visit Kiev Friday while EU foreign affairs head Catherine Ashton may travel there next week. Asked specifically about the use of sanctions, Bailly stressed that the priority for Brussels was ""not to redefine the relationship with Ukraine"". At the same time, he said Barroso had noted during his conversation with Yanukovych that ""if the situation is not stabilised,"" then the EU would ""assess the possible consequences on the relationship"". Washington for its part announced Wednesday a first set of sanctions against Kiev, withdrawing visas from individuals implicated in the violence. In Kiev meanwhile, the opposition agreed to an eight-hour truce with security forces after five days of deadly fighting but threatened to go on the attack if the government failed to agree concessions in further talks. The demonstrations first begun in late November when Yanukovych at the last moment ditched an association accord with the EU in favour of closer ties with Russia, Ukraine's Soviet-era master. The protests had appeared to be tailing off but burst violently back into life after Yanukovych pushed through tough curbs on the right to assembly and others earlier this month. bmm/hmn"
"Ukraine's new Western-backed president plans to order a unilateral cease fire in the separatist east that could help end a bloody pro-Russian insurgency and avert his ex-Soviet country's break-up. Petro Poroshenko took a further step towards relieving tensions with Russia by deciding to replace acting Foreign Minister Andriy Deshchytsya, a hate figure in Moscow, with his current envoy to OSCE-mediated negotiations with the Kremlin. But he also appealed for US and EU help to secure his country's porous border with Russia and stem the influx of arms and militants into the conflict zone. The frontier has witnessed ferocious clashes in recent weeks, in which militants armed with Russian-made rocket launchers have attacked Ukrainian border guard camps and ambushed army patrols. A Ukrainian defence spokesman said the rebels had recently ""stepped up their activities"" and killed three soldiers. But the respected Dzerkalo Tyzhnia news site reported defence sources as saying the fighting had killed 15 soldiers and left 13 others missing. Poroshenko unveiled his peace initiative on Wednesday after late-night talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin, in which the Kremlin chief also raised concern about the death in Lugansk fighting on Tuesday of two members of a Russian state TV crew. ""The peace plan begins with my order for a unilateral cease fire,"" Poroshenko told reporters in Kiev. ""Immediately after that, we must receive support for the presidential peace plan from all sides involved (in the conflict)."" Acting Defence Minister Mykhailo Koval said the order would be issued ""literally within days"". Poroshenko's plan also calls for Putin to formally recognise the new leadership in Ukraine that emerged after months of deadly pro-EU protests ousted the Russian-backed president in February. ""On the one hand, they are talking about a cease fire and on the other, they are continuing their aggression,"" Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said. Washington commended Ukraine for its ""good-faith efforts,"" but State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki added: ""Naturally, they need a partner in this effort."" Psaki said the United States had seen no indication of reciprocal good-faith efforts by Moscow. Poroshenko's office said he told German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Tuesday that Western help sealing the frontier was ""essential"". But Washington has refused to provide any combat equipment and rejects the idea of deploying ground forces in Ukraine."
"Ukraine's security service said on Thursday it had arrested an insurgent group involving three Russian nationals that had stockpiled bombs and planned to carry out ""terrorist attacks,"" in raids that cost the life of a special forces officer. ""The insurgents planned to stage terrorist acts in Kiev and Kharkiv to destabilise the situation in the country,"" a spokeswoman for the SBU security service, Olena Gitlyanska, said on Facebook. A special forces officer and a member of the insurgent group, who opened fire, were killed in operations in those cities late Wednesday and early Thursday, she said. Another special forces officer was wounded but his condition was stable, she said. ""In one apartment alone, where active resistance was put up and where the leader of the insurgent group was liquidated, eight improvised explosive devices were found,"" another SBU official, Oleksandr Tkachuk, told reporters. ""The Russian nationals were detained in another apartment. Twenty three more explosive devices were found there,"" he said. Gitlyanska added officials had also found automatic weapons, more than 40 grenades and falsified documents. Tkachuk did not rule out that the detained Russian nationals were linked to Russian special services. Kiev and the West have accused Russia of fuelling an insurgency in eastern Ukraine and sending in regular troops across the border in a conflict that has claimed more than 9,000 people since April, 2014. Russia has denied the claims. President Vladimir Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Thursday he did not have any details about the reported operation in Ukraine. osh/as/ri"

Securing the Association Agreement is seen as the first step to obtaining EU membership. However, the bloc has demanded the release of jailed opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko in exchange for the agreement. Earlier Thursday, the parliament in Kiev voted against bills that would free Tymoshenko, the 2004 Orange Revolution co-leader. ""Of course there are difficulties on the path,"" Yanukovych told journalists after meeting with his Austrian counterpart Heinz Fischer. ""We need to examine these problems and see if they can be solved or avoided,"" he added, insisting the Ukrainian parliament has passed on Thursday several other bills to fulfill EU criteria. Asked why Tymoshenko, who suffers back problems and has been offered medical treatment in Germany, could not be released, Yanukovych insisted this was a decision to be taken by the courts. ""To answer this question definitely today is impossible,"" he said, pointing to the widely opposing views of Tymoshenko in the Ukrainian parliament and abroad. ""We must stick to the law. We respect the law and the constitution. A release of Mrs. Tymoshenko is very controversial and contradictory,"" he added. Tymoshenko, a former prime minister and arch-rival of the president, was jailed in 2011 for seven years on charges of abuse of power while in office. Critics have accused Yanukovych of trying to keep her out of politics ahead of presidential elections in 2015. ssw/hmn"
"US President Barack Obama on Tuesday called on Russia to pressure separatists to stop attacking government forces in eastern Ukraine and to prevent the flow of fighters and weapons into the region. Obama made the call in a press conference in Poland and also warned that further Russian action in Ukraine could lead to stepped-up economic sanctions. ""Further Russian provocation will be met with further costs for Russia including, if necessary, additional sanctions,"" Obama said. The president, who will meet Ukrainian president-elect Petro Poroshenko in Warsaw on Wednesday, called on Russia to use its influence to ""prevent the flow of militants and weapons into eastern Ukraine."" He said President Vladimir Putin's government should also convince pro-Kremlin separatists to ""stop attacking Ukrainian security forces."" col/yad"
"Veteran British rockstar Elton John on Saturday said Ukraine still had ""a long way to go"" in its treatment of the gay, bisexual and transgender community at a conference in Kiev. ""I tell you with great sadness that right here, in this very city earlier this summer, a simple and modest gay pride parade had to be organised at a secret location to try to prevent hooligans from disrupting it and committing violence against the celebrants,"" he said. ""The march lasted, in all, 10 minutes, the fighting lasted over an hour ... So I tell you soberly, we have a long way to go,"" he told delegates at the annual Yalta European Strategy forum. The singer, who has two sons with husband David Furnish and is a veteran campaigner on gay rights, urged Ukraine to seek ways to promote the rights of those who are lesbian, gay, bisexual and transsexual (LGBT). ""Accepting people regardless of age, race, gender, ethnicity and sexual orientation is today the measure of an open, tolerant and democratic society,"" he said. ""I ask you to begin this dialogue,"" he said. ""This is a moral imperative."" Homosexuality used to be punishable by law under the former Soviet Union, and although the legislation was revised following its collapse, homophobia remains socially acceptable in Ukraine where prevailing social attitudes tend to be intolerant towards those in the LGBT community. Ukraine held its first Gay Pride parade in 2013 but the following year, it was cancelled after police refused to guarantee it would be protected. This year, around a hundred activists turned out but they were only able to march briefly through Kiev before clashes erupted with protesters throwing stones and rubbish at them. Around 10 people were hurt in the ensuing confrontation between police and ultra-nationalist demonstrators who came to break up the event. Highly popular in Ukraine, Elton John had in 2009 tried to adopt a local HIV-positive toddler but was prevented by the authorities as Ukrainian law does not permit couples in same-sex marriages to adopt. lap/all/hmw/ric"
"Vienna – Human rights, democracy, and the rule of law: Such are the fundamental values to which the member states of the Council of Europe must commit themselves, Hence there is a certain irony in the fact that, on the very day of the foreign ministers’ conference in Vienna, eight young members of the Nida civic rights movement have been sentenced to jail terms of between seven and eight years, having been officially convicted of possession of narcotics and weapons and breach of public order. in Azerbaijan, the country about to formally assume the Council’s Presidency Interviewed by Der Standard newspaper, Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Elmar Mammadyarov indirectly admitted deficits in his country, in saying: “So far as human rights, democracy, and the rule of law are concerned, there are no angels in the Council of Europe. No member state is able to say it is perfect in these areas. As for human rights, this is a process, a generational matter. Just take a look at South Korea for example, or other Asian states, where they started out, and where they now stand.” He saw the major components of this process as investment in education and welfare programs. The prerequisite for economic prosperity was the right human capital, which in its turn fostered understanding of human rights and the rule of law, said Mammadyarov, who was awarded a doctorate in political sciences in the United States. He reported that more than 5,000 Azerbaijanis were studying abroad The convicted activists had been prosecuted not on account of their political stance. but for having violated laws, in such ways as using violence, Mammadyarov affirmed. There were no political prisoners in Azerbaijan, he insisted. Such NGOs as Amnesty International take a different view, of course, and speak of at least 19 political prisoners. That sounds “like old-style Soviet propaganda,” Mammadyarov retorted, casting doubt on the independence of western human rights organizations,  a case in point being Human Rights Watch, which he said was funded by the US Congress.. Regarding his country’s relationship with the European Union, the foreign minister was markedly down-to-earth. Unlike Ukraine, Georgia, and Moldova, which had become embroiled in conflict with Russia over their own moves toward the EU, Azerbaijan, with its wealth of petroleum and gas reserves, has no interest in an association agreement with the EU: “We regard that as rather obsolete.”  Cooperation focused on expanding Azerbaijani gas supplies to the EU, which was of mutual interest. However, even with maximum use of all its capacities, Azerbaijan itself would only have very limited ability to make up for any large-scale shortfall in Russian gas supplies, resulting from western sanctions over the Ukraine crisis, Russia’s annexation of the Crimea is condemned by the Baku government, on the grounds that: “We see the territorial integrity not only of Ukraine, but also of such countries as Georgia and Moldova, with ongoing territorial conflicts (South Ossetia/ Abkhazia, Transnistria – editor’s note) [as published] as a must.” Referring to the conflict over the Nagorno-Karabakh or Mountainous Karabagh region, Mammadyarov pointed out that 20 percent of Azerbaijani territory was presently occupied by Armenian troops, whose withdrawal he saw as an indispensable precondition for any solution. This could take the form of the optimum degree of autonomy for the Armenian enclaves, for example by emulating the model of South Tirol [largely German-speaking province of Italy, on its border with Austria].  "
"Washington's UN ambassador was set Wednesday to meet Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko at a time of renewed hostilities with pro-Russian fighters and fears of the Western-backed state's imminent debt default. Samantha Power's show of support for Poroshenko's embattled team will also see her speak to Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin and senior cabinet members. The avowed critic of Russia and promoter of the ex-Soviet state's budding alliance with Europe has scheduled a public appearance in Kiev for Thursday. Power's visit comes one year into a presidency Poroshenko has used to try and wipe out more than two decades of crippling corruption and anaemic economic performance that left successive administrations reliant on Russian help. But his efforts have been both stuttering and increasingly unpopular. The 14-month war against eastern insurgents has waxed and waned depending on both sides' abidance by a series of broad truce and political dialogue deals. The latest ceasefire forged with France and Germany's help in February threatened to rupture last week as barrages of artillery and rocket fire killed around 30 people living in towns straddling the twisting -- and hotly disputed -- line separating the two foes. The violence has since subsided and appears to have returned to past levels of sporadic shelling that kill people daily in a conflict the United Nations estimates has already claimed nearly 6,500 lives. But voter displeasure at the seemingly perpetual separatist conflict is being compounded by basic economic concerns. The inflation rate has soared to more than 60 percent while government assistance -- to everyone from pensioners to war veterans and students -- has been slashed under the advice of an IMF team overseeing Ukraine's long-term recovery plan. The International Monetary Fund has been holding back loans it earmarked in a $17.5-billion rescue due to Kiev's failure to agree debt restructuring terms with its private lenders or plug holes in its cash-draining state energy firm. Ukrainian Finance Minister Natalie Jaresko warned Friday that Kiev may be forced to stop servicing its commercial loans within a matter of weeks. The explicit nature of the threat seemed to rattle the fund. Its senior managers had until then argued that such a technical default would complicate the approval of the next $1.7-billion (1.5-billion-euro) tranche when the IMF board meets later this month. But its second in command signalled Tuesday that Kiev could still get the money without a debt deal. ""We have a policy of lending into arrears which allows us to continue lending to a member state when it has arrears with private creditors,"" said First Deputy Managing Director David Lipton in Washington. Political analysts view Power as one of US President Barack Obama's diplomatic attack dogs on Russia whose heated exchanges at the United Nations with her Moscow colleague have been pilloried and satirised on Kremlin-run TV. ""Let us pull the veil away from (Russian President Vladimir) Putin's peace plan and call it for what it is -- a Russian occupation plan,"" she told the UN Security Council in January. Power has since strongly defended the waves of sanctions that Washington and Brussels adopted in the wake of Putin's annexation of Crimea and alleged military intervention in Ukraine's industrial southeast. Yet Ukrainian leaders are keenly aware that past financial and other sanctions against Russia appear to have done little to alter Putin's stance. A threat by G7 leaders Monday to toughen restrictions against Moscow drew an acerbic response from Putin's powerful administration chief. ""It is perfectly logical to assume that Russia will extend its own sanctions,"" Interfax quoted Sergei Ivanov as saying. Kiev analysts said Poroshenko might try yet again to convince Power that Washington should back the deployment of UN peacekeepers in the war zone -- a step rejected by Russia and looked upon sceptically by the West. ""I think this is a gesture of US good will,"" political analyst Oleksiy Golobutsky told AFP. ""But I doubt that we should expect any tangible results,"" he added. zak/fg"
"World AUTHOR: Nick O'Malley, United States Correspondent PUBDATE: September 28, 2014 - 12:00AM (BK - The Age) - President Obama meets Australian PM Tony Abbott in New York. Photo: Kym Smith It must have been a faintly chilling moment for Barack Obama. He had spent half the week talking up the Iraqi government as responsive and inclusive, mature enough to sustain the international alliance growing to fight militants of the Islamic State. Then came those bizarre press comments. The week had begun with a success, or what passes for success when one is dealing with the reluctant re-entry into what may well be an unwinnable war. Critics had declared that the President and his Secretary of State, John Kerry, had failed even before the first hurdle because they had been unable to muster the support of key Arab nations. Confusion: Iraqi PM Haider al-Abadi, left, stunned American reporters by informing them that Iraq had ""credible"" evidence that the Islamic State planned to bomb New York. Photo: Kevin Lamarque ""No one believes President Obama's strategy in Iraq will work — not the Republicans, not the Democrats, not the Generals, not the American people,"" wrote Marc Thiessen, a former speechwriter for George W. Bush and Donald Rumsfeld in a scathing  Washington Post  opinion piece published on Monday. ""So it's little wonder that our allies are questioning the strategy as well and finding ways to avoid making specific commitments."" Less that 24 hours later America and five Sunni Arab nations - Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain and Jordan began bombing targets in Syria. The following day, after a bilateral meeting with the new Iraqi Prime Minister, Haider al-Abadi, President Obama said, ""One of the things I'm very impressed with, however, is the fact that Prime Minister Abadi understands that in order for Iraq to succeed it's not just a matter of a military campaign; it's also the need for political outreach to all factions within the country.  And I've been very impressed with Prime Minister Abadi's vision.  ""Since he took over the prime-ministership, he has reached out systematically to all the peoples of Iraq.  He has articulated a vision of reform and a commitment to moving forward with many of the laws that had previously stalled but offer the potential of unleashing energy and entrepreneurship inside of Iraq."" When he addressed the General Assembly the  next day President Obama was uncharacteristically forceful. He denounced Russian aggression in Ukraine and having listed Islamic State atrocities he said: ""No God condones this terror.  No grievance justifies these actions.  There can be no reasoning -no negotiation - with this brand of evil.  The only language understood by killers like this is the language of force.  So the United States of America will work with a broad coalition to dismantle this network of death."" He called for the world to join this effort, a call he could make with more authority in the wake of the alliance bombings. On Friday, Britain, Belgium and Denmark overcame domestic political hurdles to join the coalition. But by then the global leaders who had gathered in New York, including Prime Minister Tony Abbott, must have been wondering about the reliability of Haider al-Abadi. On Thursday he had stunned a small group of American reporters covering the General Assembly, telling them that Iraq had ""credible"" evidence that Islamic State terrorists planned to bomb Paris and New York subway systems. ""They plan to have attacks in the metros of Paris and the US,"" he said. ""I asked [Iraqi intelligence] for more credible information. I asked for names. I asked for details, for cities, you know, dates. And from the details I have received, yes, it looks credible."" US officials were stunned. They had no information about an attack, either from their own sources or from Iraq's. Soon Ben Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser to President Obama, said the US had ""not confirmed any specific threat"". ""What we've consistently said to the Iraqis is if they have information that is relevant to terrorist activity or terrorist plotting, that they can and should share that through our intelligence and law enforcement channels,"" Rhodes said.  ""We would certainly take seriously any information they are learning,"" he said. The New York mayor, Bill de Blasio, reassured New Yorkers they were safe and the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Iraq and Iran, Brett McGurk, told CNN there was no ""specific credible threat whatsoever that they have uncovered to the United States."" Nor could French authorities shed any light on the statement. On Friday, the Iraqi President Fuad Masum seemed just as confused as he sat down for a long Q and A session during a Council on Foreign Relations event in New York. ""Personally I don't have any information about this,"" he said. ""I have not heard or seen exactly what he said."" ""It could be an expectation of this to happen by a sleeper cell and they retaliate - they could resort to such things. ""The nature of the statement, how it was made, was not very clear and I tried to ask him but he's on his way to Baghdad on a plane, that's why I could not get hold of him."" Critics note that for all its rhetoric neither Abadi's government nor Iraq's military is yet reformed or representative. In fact his cabinet is not  yet complete. He is, as President Obama insists, the key ally on what many predict will be a long and complicated military campaign that will fail without the American troops that America is not willing to send. His comments on Thursday hardly inspired much faith."
