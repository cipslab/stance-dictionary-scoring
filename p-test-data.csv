"""Donetsk People's Republic"" leadership declares independence, seeks accession to Russia (Part 2) MOSCOW. May 12 (Interfax) - Leadership of the ""Donetsk People's Republic"" has declared independence of the region and has sough accession to Russia. ""Upon the results of the referendum held on May 11, 2014 and based on the sovereignty declaration of the Donetsk People's Republic, we, people of the Donetsk People's Republic, declare that from now on the Donetsk People's Republic is a sovereign state,"" co-chairman of the ""Donetsk People's Republic"" government Denis Pushilin said at a news conference on Monday. ""We ask to consider the issue of accession of the Donetsk People's Republic to Russia,"" Pushilin said. According to Pushilin, the supreme council formed by the ""Donetsk People's Republic"" government and security council will become the higher state body of the ""Donetsk People's Republic."" ""The Donetsk region has always been part of the Russian world regardless of ethnic affiliation,"" Pushilin said. ""For us Russia's history is our history. Russian and Soviet victories, including in the Great patriotic Warm are our common victories,"" he said. ""The Donetsk region was part of the Russian empire initially,"" Pushilin said. ""Only after the bloody catastrophe of 1917 it turned out to be separated by conventional administrative borders from big Russia,"" he said. ""We lived most part of the 20th century as part of Ukraine but this was possible only due to the fact that Ukraine itself was territorial formation of the single state,"" Pushilin said. After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, ""our people still hoped that Ukraine, Russia and Belarus will restore their historical unity,"" Pushilin said. ""This hope crashed completely in March 2014, when the Kyiv junta professing neo-Nazi fascist ideology seized power in Ukraine during the revolt,"" he said. ez",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""Project Novorossiya is closed!"" -- this news caused despondency in the ""patriots"" camp and glee in the Ukrainian media. ""They dumped Novorossiya, they betrayed the Russians, all the sacrifices were in vain!"" -- so said those who like to talk about the ""dump party"" in the Kremlin. But what really happened? We talked about this with a person who was directly involved in the events that led to the formation of the present Donets'ka and Luhans'ka People's Republics in the territory of Ukraine -- political scientist Aleksandr Boroday, former prime minister of the DNR [Donets'ka People's Republic]. [Perevozkina] Oleh Tsaryov, ex-deputy from the Party of Regions and head of the parliament of Novorossiya, recently stated that Project ""Novorossiya"" is closed. Various versions of this news were widely disseminated in the media. Is it really true? Is Project ""Novorossiya"" closed? [Boroday] It depends on what you mean by the word ""project."" Novorossiya is not so much a project as an idea. If you like, the people's idea, and a rather self-evident one. Because Novorossiya is, in reality, a certain region of Russia that was at one time, through the efforts of people like Potemkin and Suvorov at the time of the rule of Catherine II, incorporated into Russia. These were lands that had been under Turkish protection and dominion in one way or another but which, after a series of Russian-Turkish wars resulting in Russian success, went to Russia. That was how Novorossiya was formed. [Perevozkina] As I understand it, back at the time when an independent republic was being formed in Transnistria, certain people who took part in this also professed the idea of a greater Novorossiya incorporating Transnistria. [Boroday] The founder of Tiraspol was Aleksandr Vasilyevich Suvorov. It is only natural that this idea arose at that time, because there is such thing as historical memory. And it begins to operate at critical moments in Russian history. This historical memory has also operated now. At present as a result of the events that have taken place we must acknowledge with regret that Novorossiya as such, as some kind of statehood, does not, de facto, exist. It is a dream that has not yet come true. But that does not mean that it will not come true in the future. It is another matter that various Russian patriots have interpreted this dream in different ways. Some consider Novorossiya to be a region that should actually be part of Russia. I myself am among that number and I hope that this will happen sooner or later. There are also those who were hoping to build a state of Novorossiya that would be a satellite of Russia but still separate from it, a state that would become a kind of ""ideal Rus."" This idea did not become reality and I do not consider it viable. In practice there are two republics in the Donbas [Donets Basin] that exist separately but which support each other in the struggle against the Kyiv regime. [Perevozkina] Were documents on the formation of Novorossiya ever signed? [Boroday] Yes, a kind of declaration was signed. I was involved in this, my signature is on it too. This was in May of last year. At that time we were still proceeding on the basis of the possibility of the implementation of a Crimea scenario. Since the Crimea scenario did not happen, the idea of Novorossiya was also not really needed. Resistance to the Ukrainian junta in territories other than the Donbas proved insufficiently strong -- and was cruelly suppressed. Active people who were prepared to uphold the ideals of the ""Russian World"" and historical justice were either arrested and subjected to repressions, or emigrated to Russia, or else moved to the territory of the Donets'ka and Luhans'ka Republics, joined the ranks of the militia, and are bearing arms and fighting there. [Perevozkina] The uprisings in the spring of last year took place practically simultaneously in several cities in historical Novorossiya. This prompts the idea of some kind of synchronization of these actions. So, after all, did Project ""Novorossiya"" as some kind of plan formulated by someone exist in the first place? Set forth on paper, with the authors' signatures, then approved and ratified by someone as guidance for action? [Boroday] As far as I know, no plan existed in that form. [Perevozkina] So in what form did it exist? [Boroday] In the form of an idea, of course. This idea was taken up by the masses of the people. [Perevozkina] And whose idea was it? [Boroday] I do not know of any originator, it arose naturally. [Perevozkina] Which republics were supposed to form part of this greater Novorossiya? [Boroday] It is fairly obvious that it was supposed to include Kharkivs'ka, Donets'ka, Luhans'ka, Khersons'ka, Odes'ka, Zaporiz'ka, Dnipropetrovs'ka, and Mykolayivs'ka Oblasts. Eight oblasts in total. Those are the natural borders of Novorossiya. [Perevozkina] What does Tsaryov mean when he talks about the closure of Project Novorossiya? [Boroday] His organization specifically is closed. That is, the Parliament of Novorossiya. Because there is nothing for it to do. There are no territories of Novorossiya, there are only the Donets'ka and Luhans'ka Republics. There is no government of Novorossiya, there are the governments of these two republics. [Perevozkina] So who was behind this specific project that Tsaryov led? Who was lobbying for it? Who was supporting it in the Presidential Staff? [Boroday] Ask Tsaryov. [Perevozkina] He had an office in Moscow and some kind of funding. Where did he get that from? [Boroday] Oleh Tsaryov, to the best of my knowledge, is quite a well-off businessman. [Perevozkina] They took everything away from him in Ukraine. [Boroday] Everything or not everything, I do not know. I have not looked in Tsaryov's pocket. I do not think it was everything. To the best of my knowledge he was investing his own money in this project. [Perevozkina] Back at the very beginning, in April 2014, I had a feeling that Tsaryov was somehow not very well received in Donets'k. [Boroday] There was a kind of anarchy there at that time. All kinds of plans and possibilities were being discussed. As far as Oleh Tsaryov personally is concerned, yes, he did indeed have some problems with acceptability in Donets'k and Luhans'k because he himself is from Dnipropetrovs'k. And one region is distinguished from another there and it is understood that the ""Donets folk"" keep themselves somewhat apart. [Perevozkina] So what is the result: To all appearances, Russia was satisfied with the creation of the LNR [Luhans'ka People's Republic] and the DNR [Donets'ka People's Republic] and is refusing to fight for other components of historical Novorossiya? [Boroday] I cannot and will not answer for the Russian Federation. And what does ""fight"" mean? You know the actual line of the Russian Federation Government. It is that Russia does not interfere in Ukraine's sovereign affairs. That is the official view, it was articulated not by me but by many Russian Federation state figures, including the president. [Perevozkina] But what is your personal attitude to this? [Boroday] Personally, at the beginning of the events, in May-June, I really sincerely expected the Russian Federation to intervene directly and openly. To send in the troops and help the people of the Donbas and other oblasts of Ukraine to exercise their will, which was to become part of Russia. Not to form some kind of new state but simply to become part of the Russian Federation. [Perevozkina] To restore historical justice? [Boroday] At least part of historical justice. Because in my view Malorossiya [Little Russia] became detached from Russia as a result of the event that became known as the ""breakup of the Soviet Union."" There was a referendum in which the overwhelming majority of citizens of the USSR (around 90 percent, if I am not mistaken), including those living in Ukraine, voted against the breakup of the Soviet Union. Nonetheless disintegration took place, and borders that were purely administrative, not affecting anything, suddenly became real borders between states. Of course historical justice consists in the disappearance of these borders. Because people live on both sides of these borders who have the identical mentality, the identical education, the identical historical memory, who are linked by a single historical destiny and blood relationship ties. [Perevozkina] If it goes on like this, after a generation no common historical memory and no ties will remain. [Boroday] Yes, it is a tragic situation. After all, Ukraine's name is no accident. It is the ""kray"" [province], the ""okraina"" [outlying district], and there is nothing offensive about that. Vladivostok is also an outlying district of Russia, but its residents do not feel like second-class citizens. There is only one question: Is Ukraine the western outpost of the Russian world or the eastern outpost of the Western world? Not for the first time in its long history, the Slav world is being divided. A Slav Polish-Lithuanian state also sprang up at one time -- the Rzeczpospolita. And after a while the Catholic Rzeczpospolita, ideologically trampled by the West, became the worst enemy of the Russian world and of Russia. Now there is an attempt, inspired to a significant degree by the West, to turn Ukraine into something like Poland in relation to Russia. [Perevozkina] So this attempt must be resisted? [Boroday] Yes, it must be resisted as much as possible. But I do not make the decisions on the forms that this resistance should take. [Perevozkina] Can you tell us how you got involved in this story at all? How you ended up in Crimea? [Boroday] I went there. [Perevozkina] With the help of your friend Strelkov? [Boroday] Without help. I went to support the Crimeans, and specifically Serhiy Aksyonov. Just like Strelkov also went. In fact I turned up in Crimea a day or two later than Igor Strelkov, but without me he might not have gone to Crimea. Whereas I would have gone even without Igor Strelkov. [Perevozkina] That sounds intriguing. Why so? [Boroday] That was how the situation developed. No further comment. [Perevozkina] Because you introduced him to [Konstantin] Malofeyev [Russian businessman alleged to have funded rebel militias in eastern Ukraine]. [Boroday] Not only because of that. [Perevozkina] After Crimea, you left for the Donbas. You say you were expecting intervention by Russia in the events in the Donbas. [Boroday] If it proved necessary. When we left for the Donbas we still did not really understand how events would actually develop. [Perevozkina] So you went there without having any guarantees that Russia, if necessary, would protect the local population? [Boroday] Right. [Perevozkina] And nobody said to you: Guys, you start, and we will support you? [Boroday] No. [Perevozkina] So it turns out that you were simply playing the role of… [Boroday] Volunteers. [Perevozkina] ...No offense -- provocateurs trying to provoke the response they wanted from Russia? You were presenting the Russian Federation leadership with a fait accompli: The war has begun, people are dying, please help? [Boroday] We were not trying to blackmail anyone. We went there as volunteers. To help. A great many people approached us back in Crimea to ask for just one thing: ""Please help."" And when the question of how to help was raised, the answer was simple: ""As commanders, as leaders, be the leaders."" [Perevozkina] Was it the locals who were telling you they needed a leader? [Boroday] Yes. The people of Donets'k, Luhans'k, Kharkiv. Whoever you like. [Perevozkina] Strelkov actually said that this was what he was counting on. That he started the uprising in Slovyans'k in the expectation that Russia would intervene. [Boroday] He said a lot of things. He did not start the uprising. It started without him. He only went to Slovyans'k. At that time precisely the same kind of events were also happening in Donets'k and in other cities in the Donbas. And Strelkov was not there. I called on him in Slovyans'k in April. Then I went to Donets'k. Initially I went there as a political scientist for research purposes. [Perevozkina] And then they invited you to become prime minister. [Boroday] It turned out that there was no alternative. And since I am a Russian patriot and ideologically support the movement that was beginning in the Donbas back then, naturally I could not remain aloof. [Perevozkina] So the reaction from Russia was not what you expected? [Boroday] The reaction from Russia was not what we were hoping for, but at the same time none of us, at least not me, is making any accusations against the Russian Federation. Because we understand that the Russian Federation's reaction is determined by a great many factors of every kind, in particular foreign policy factors. And that the most important objective for the leadership of the Russian Federation is the prosperity of Russia itself and its citizens. On this basis the Russian leadership could have made this or that decision. And it had the right to make those decisions. None of us has the right to condemn the leadership of the Russian Federation because of these decisions. Maybe if Russian troops had been sent into the territory of Novorossiya back then, in the spring of 2014, the kind of bloodshed that happened and which is still continuing would not have ensued. But it could also have been very different. The leadership of the Russian Federation had a great many considerations on the basis of which it made a different decision. [Perevozkina] You say yourself that the people who live in Novorossiya are not very different from Russian citizens. [Boroday] That is true. And the Russian leadership provided political, moral, and humanitarian support to the people of the Donbas. The political support led, in particular, to the conclusion of the Minsk Accords and forced people in Kyiv to sit at the negotiating table and to recognize Donets'k and Luhans'k as parties to the conflict. Moral support -- the Russian media demonstrate that extremely well. The humanitarian support is also quite obvious. Probably more than 100 humanitarian convoys have already entered the territory of the LNR and the DNR. [Perevozkina] People living there claim that all this humanitarian aid is being stolen and sold on the markets. [Boroday] I think there are instances of corruption, but not so universal. [Perevozkina] The tone in the state media has also changed recently. It appears that they are gradually preparing people for the idea that the DNR and the LNR will remain part of Ukraine, even without the rights of federation components. [Boroday] I would not draw such far-reaching conclusions. Despite the endless wailing about how poor Novorossiya, Donets'k, and Luhans'k were ""dumped on"" by the Russian Federation leaders, the Donets'ka and Luhans'ka Republics still exist today. Despite all the circumstances. Despite the fact that Ukraine is still, in effect, waging a war against them and the Minsk Accords are not being particularly observed. They have been in existence for more than a year now. During that time their statehood has strengthened substantially. [Perevozkina] The question is whether they will exist much longer. [Boroday] I am not about to make predictions. The situation is changing very rapidly. Furthermore I believe the existence of the DNR and the LNR is in principle a temporary thing. Because the Donbas should not and will not be independent. In my view these regions should be incorporated in one way or another into the Russian Federation. But that is my personal view. [Perevozkina] What about the other regions? [Boroday] I think Ukraine is doomed to disintegrate. [Perevozkina] You were saying that a year ago. But still it goes on and on not disintegrating… [Boroday] Ukraine has not disintegrated yet only because of the effect of the very strong organizational and financial resources of the West, which is not permitting it to break up into its components. This is an unnatural statehood. It is not actually a statehood in principle, in my view. Throughout its 23 years Ukraine has essentially been a kind of oligarchate only outwardly presented as a statehood. The fact that it is now disintegrating is a fait accompli. As of today three of the most important regions have already dropped away from Ukraine. The DNR, the LNR, and Crimea. When I said that Ukraine would finally disintegrate within the year I was not taking into account the powerful resources of the West, which mobilized the whole of the rest of Ukraine for the war against the Donbas. It is only the mobilization for the war against the ""Russian world,"" of which the LNR and the DNR are the vanguard, that is preventing Ukraine from disintegrating for the time being. If this war should come to an end, a great many questions would arise within Ukraine for its leadership. And if you take into account the extremely threadbare state of the Ukrainian economy, I think Ukraine will collapse practically immediately after the end of the war. Therefore what is called the Ukrainian statehood and the present Kyiv ""elite,"" so-called, are in a rather difficult, stalemate situation. They have practically no resources to continue the war. They understand that if they run into yet another serious military defeat it will be a huge problem for the stability of present-day Ukraine as a state, but they also cannot not continue the war. Because then legitimate questions would arise about their effectiveness and the need for all this mobilization and the casualties that have already occurred. And also questions about the state of the Ukrainian economy. At the moment it is being maintained exclusively by the West's financial resources. [Perevozkina] And also those of Russia, which is continuing to supply Ukraine with gas, coal, and electricity at concessionary rates. Even Poroshenko's enterprises are continuing to work in Russia as if nothing had happened. [Boroday] Which only goes to show that the Russian leadership is demonstrating that it has no interest in the disintegration of Ukraine. But specifically as a political scientist I believe that this disintegration is predetermined. Because at a certain point the external factors will cease to operate. The West absolutely does not want to go on feeding and supplying Ukraine indefinitely, and this is not to its advantage. Furthermore Ukraine in itself is of no interest to the West, and particularly the United States. For them, this is some kind of godforsaken spot on the map of the world. Therefore as soon as the situation is exhausted Ukraine will disintegrate of its own accord under the weight of internal contradictions. [Perevozkina] I wonder which will happen first: whether Ukraine will disintegrate or whether it, in conjunction with Moldova, will suppress independent Transnistria. This, in my view, is the next item on the agenda for our ""Western partners."" [Boroday] For all the delicacy of Russia's position it is still capable of rebuffing the West's aggressive aspirations. As for the person who leads Russia -- I think Vladimir Putin is a very smart, subtle, and experienced politician. True, he is not inclined to publish all his plans or issue program statements. [Perevozkina] Do you think he has plans? [Boroday] I am not personally acquainted with Vladimir Putin but I am confident he knows what he is doing. Our leader is not short of experience, intelligence, and will. [Perevozkina] Does [Vladislav] Surkov [Putin's adviser on Ukraine] also know what he is doing? [Boroday] Why this question? Surkov is a state official. He does not operate autonomously. He operates in accordance with the line determined, first and foremost, by the president of the Russian Federation. Surkov, in this sense, is not an autonomous player. True, he is a brilliant person and his personality gives rise to a great deal of talk and gossip. Empty, as a rule. [Perevozkina] As I understand it, his line is to conduct a policy with the support of the local oligarchs and on the basis of agreements among the oligarchs. The report that Mariupol' was not taken for the reason that this would have damaged the business of the Donets'k oligarch Akhmetov came as a real shock to me personally. The recently killed brigade commander Mozhovyy held different views: He understood the uprising in the Donbas specifically as a people's anti-oligarchic revolution. Is that why he was killed? [Boroday] I have no special theories about who killed Mozhovyy or why. I did not know him well. We had a real conversation only once: when I left Slovyans'k in April 2014 and met him at the border. Later I saw him once or twice in Donets'k. I am not prepared to comment either on him as an individual or on the circumstances of his death. [Perevozkina] He thought the struggle against the oligarchs was the subject on which people living in both eastern and western oblasts of Ukraine could come together, and then the revolution would happen on a countrywide scale. [Boroday] What kind of revolution? Socialist? Personally I am an opponent of socialism in any of its manifestations. [Perevozkina] Anti-oligarchic. [Boroday] I became sick and tired of anti-oligarchic fervor long ago. Experience shows that it is usually a cover for commonplace looting. ""Let us 'nationalize' something, then quickly split it up or cut it up for scrap metal and then sell it… To Ukraine, naturally."" So, say you are honest ""anti-oligarchs."" You take some oligarch or other and hang him from a lamp-post. The people's wrath is satisfied. And what next? What do you do with his property? Who among the people's masses knows how to manage it? You have acquired export products, where will you sell them? You nationalize an enterprise and go to the international market with this output. You knock on the doors. And they turn you around and hand you over to the police. Because from the viewpoint of international legislation you are thieves. And nobody will buy anything from you. And all the plants you nationalized grind to a halt. And the workers who used to work at them start to go hungry. And nothing else will come of all that social revolution and anti-oligarchic fervor. Although I also understand those who, having lived their lives in Ukraine, hate the omnipotence of the oligarchs. But the cure for oligarchic tyranny is not nationalization but merely the existence of a state that restricts that power. The existence of the normal institutions of statehood, which have never before existed in ""independent Ukraine."" [Perevozkina] It is strange to hear such things from a former correspondent for the Red newspaper Zavtra. [Boroday] What do you mean, the Red newspaper Zavtra ? Zavtra is a patriotic publication in whose pages both ""Red"" and ""White"" views coexisted and were respected, notional as those distinctions may be.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(adds details, context) VIENNA, May 27 (Itar-Tass) - The special observer mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in Ukraine said Tuesday it has lost contact with its team working in the Donetsk Region in eastern Ukraine. According to an OSCE news release, the organization was last in touch with the group of four monitors at 18.00 local time on Monday, when the group was involved in planned patrols of Donetsk""s eastern part. The OSCE said it is continuing efforts to establish contact with the group, adding that the Ukrainian government and regional authorities have been informed. Instability embraced Ukraine after the country saw a coup in February. New people were brought to power amid riots as security concerns caused President Viktor Yanukovich to leave the country the same month. Massive protests against the new Ukrainian authorities erupted in Ukraine’s Russian-speaking southeastern territories after the secession of the Crimean Peninsula, which declared independence on March 11 and joined Russia on March 18 following a referendum. Demonstrators in southeastern regions, who have been demanding the country’s federalization, seized some government buildings. Kiev has been conducting what it has dubbed ""an antiterrorism operation"" against pro-federalization activists. Russia, which does not recognize the new Kiev authorities, has said the operation is punitive. The eastern Ukrainian Donetsk and Lugansk regions held referendums on May 11, in which most voters supported independence from Ukraine. Denis Pushilin, the chairman of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) Supreme Council presidium, told Itar-Tass that more than 50 militiamen and 20-50 civilians have died since Ukrainian law enforcers launched the active phase of their military operation in Donetsk on Monday. Donetsk Mayor Alexander Lukyanchenko confirmed the death of at least 40 people in clashes near the city airport. Ukrainian parliament-appointed interior minister Arsen Avakov confirmed that ""dozens"" died as a result of Kiev’s operation in Donetsk. Clashes near the Sergey Prokofyev International Airport in Donetsk started on Monday morning. Ukraine’s law enforcers used attack aircraft, including fighters and combat helicopters. Fighting in the area was ongoing all day and throughout the night. Now the situation in the city is calm, the DPR says.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(adds) MOSCOW, June 18 (Itar-Tass) - Prospects for contacts between the Russian leadership and Ukraine’s leaders will depend on how long the punitive operation of the Ukrainian Armed Forces continues in the east of the much-troubled country, Dr. Alexei Pushkov, the chairman of the State Duma foreign policy committee told a news conference Wednesday. ""In my assessment, it would be essential for (Ukrainian President Petro) Poroshenko to issue an order on a ceasefire so as to make a contact with the Russian President possible, because any such contacts are rather problematic in amid combat actions,"" he said. ""The stance of the Russian government towards Kiev depends in many ways on whether or not the punitive operation continues,"" Dr. Pushkov said. He also hailed President Poroshenko’s decision to replace the Ukrainian Foreign Minister and to appoint diplomat Pavel Klimkin to the post. ""I think it’s a correct decision,"" Dr. Pushkov said, adding that the former acting minister, Andrei Deshchytsya, was ""lost for the diplomatic sphere"" after last Saturday’s violent incident in Kiev, in which he addressed an obscene insult to Vladimir Putin. ""His verbal escapade crossed him out of the diplomats’ ranks,"" he said. ""Deshchytsya displayed professional inaptitude and I don’t think the foreign ministers of other countries would continue treating him seriously after a declaration of this kind."" Saturday, June 14, a mob of radicals in Kiev assaulted the Russian embassy, overturning the diplomats’ cars and hurling Molotov cocktails at the building. Andrei Deshchytsya who arrived at the spot of the incident took the liberty of making an obscene remark against the Russian leadership. Wednesday, Pyotr Poroshenko filed a request with the Verkhovna Rada, the national parliament, to relieve Deshchytsya of ministerial duties and to appoint the former ambassador to Germany, Pavel Klimkin , to the post.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(Updated with new figures for those injured and detained.) MOSCOW/WASHINGTON, January 20 (RIA Novosti) – The United States has slammed Ukrainian authorities over violent clashes between police and demonstrators in the capital Sunday and threatened to impose sanctions if force is used against protesters. Dozens were injured in Kiev as police deployed water cannons, stun grenades and tear gas against protesters throwing Molotov cocktails, fireworks and other projectiles at police, international news agencies reported. National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said the US is deeply concerned about the latest clashes. Hayden said the Ukrainian government ""has moved to weaken the foundations of Ukraine's democracy by criminalizing peaceful protest and stripping civil society and political opponents of key democratic protections under the law,"" Associated Press reported. She called on Ukraine to open a dialogue with the opposition. The White House says the US is considering measures including sanctions if the Ukrainian government uses violence, echoing a warning from the US State Department last month. A crowd of tens of thousands of demonstrators gathered in downtown Kiev on Sunday to protest new legislation that lawmakers hurriedly passed last week to limit protests. Tensions ran high well into the night as police reportedly used water cannons and tear gas against demonstrators near the parliament building, while protesters hurled various objects and smoke bombs at police. The violence continued despite appeals from opposition leaders, including Vitaly Klitschko, at the scene. The Interior Ministry said Monday that a hundred police officers had been injured, of whom at least 61 were hospitalized. Six police cars were burned, it said. Ukraine’s Unian news agency cited authorities as saying 103 protesters had sought medical assistance as of early Monday morning, with 42 of them hospitalized. More than 20 people have been detained and an investigation has been opened into mass rioting, police said. Media reports said a film crew from the US-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty had been held by the police, but officials had not issued any confirmation as of Monday afternoon. Two men who identified themselves as construction workers said they had been hiding from the clashes when a group of riot policemen ordered them to strip before beating them and pouring water over them, Ukraine’s Channel 5 reported. Temperatures are well below zero degrees Celsius in Kiev. City police said they were looking into the claims. President Viktor Yanukovych said late Sunday on his official website that he had instructed National Security and Defense Council head Andriy Klyuyev to form a working group of ministers, and presidential administration officials to work on the settlement of the political crisis. Vadim Kolesnichenko, a lawmaker with Yanukovych’s Party of Regions, said “foreign special services” were behind the anti-government protests, Korrespondent.net website reported Monday. He defended the new law on protests as similar to those existing in Europe and the US. Sunday’s rally, one of the biggest this year, was the latest in a series of large-scale street protests that kicked off around Ukraine in November after the government announced it would postpone the signing of association and trade deals with the European Union, opting instead to strengthen ties with Moscow.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(Updates with paras 3-5) MOSCOW, June 19 (Sputnik) - The ""artificial restriction"" in the form of Western sanctions against Russia will not last long, First Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov said Friday. ""The Europeans want to work with the Russians, the Russians can invest in Europe. And so these artificial restrictions in the form of sanctions cannot last long,"" Shuvalov said at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum. His remark comes ahead of the June 25-26 EU summit in Brussels, where the European leaders are expected to discuss the prolongation of anti-Russia sanctions that expire in July. Moscow has said it will not leave any new possible sanctions by the West without response. The European Union and other Western countries have introduced several rounds of sanctions against Russia since 2014, accusing Moscow of involvement in the armed conflict in Ukraine. Moscow has repeatedly denied the accusations, calling the sanctions counterproductive, and retaliated with a one-year food embargo on imports from the European Union.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(Updates with paras 7-11) MOSCOW, April 27 (Sputnik) - Russia will not change its stance and will not quit supporting the compatriots as a result of the Ukrainian crisis, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Monday. ""I do not feel that this Ukrainian drama will result in a surrender of our positions and a refusal to support our compatriots,"" Lavrov said in an interview to Russia 24 television. He pointed out that President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly stressed that nobody can force a wedge between Russia and the Ukrainian people. ""The fact that there [in Ukraine] has occurred an unconstitutional coup and ultra-radical forces have taken power, which are still to some extent running the show and have been branded a ""war party,"" it does not negate the above said,"" Russian top diplomat added. Lavrov stressed that Russia has become a target of an unprecedented campaign of confrontation aimed at isolating the country on the international arena. ""The goal has been proclaimed clearly - to isolate Russia. It has failed ... Those, who have unleashed this campaign, begin to realize its futility,"" Lavrov pointed out. Speaking on the subject of the Minsk deal, the implementation of which European Council President Donald Tusk said earlier remains the ""best chance"" of settling the year-long conflict in Ukraine, Lavrov pointed to Kiev's evasion of its responsibilities. ""The February 12 Minsk agreements are very difficult to misconstrue, they are highly specific... The fact that Kiev's leadership violates and interprets them as they see fit is becoming increasingly evident,"" the Russian diplomat said. The ceasefire deal reached in the Belarusian capital envisioned an immediate ceasefire in the region, a pullout of heavy artillery, prisoner exchanges, as well as a series of constitutional reforms. As part of the deal coordinated by France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine, Kiev undertook to decentralize powers, hold special elections and grant southeast Ukraine's Donetsk and Luhansk regions special status by the year's end. The Ukrainian conflict began last April two months after the ouster of President Viktor Yanukovych, who opted out of signing an association agreement with the European Union. The country's southeastern population refused to accept the February coup and proclaimed independence, triggering an armed response from government forces and leading to the loss of over 6,000 lives, according to UN estimates.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[Computer selected and disseminated without OSE editorial intervention] Baltic states favor greater presence of NATO allies in region to restrain Russia - Latvian Foreign Minister BRUSSELS. Dec 3 (Interfax/BNS) - Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia favor developing a mechanism of long-term, expanded and significant presence of NATO allies sufficient ""to restrain any type of aggressive actions"" on the part of Russia by the summit of the alliance in July. After a conference of foreign ministers of NATO member-states Latvian Foreign Minister Edgards Rinkevics said that the talks focus not on the establishment of permanent NATO bases in the Baltic region but on preparing a solution for the Warsaw summit of NATO that would guarantee a sufficient mechanism of restraint. Other countries of the Eastern flank of NATO, such as Poland and Romania, also favor that. ""This means more expanded, even greater presence of NATO allies without any definitely set terms. Not the stylistic discussion of some one or other phrase, not the way to call all this but the real presence of allies is in our interests now. Work continues on concrete issues but I have seen that our colleagues on both the Eastern and Southern flanks are determined to do their utmost for this long-term NATO presence in the Baltic, Poland or the so-called Eastern flank to happen and that it would be sufficient,"" Rinkevics said. Ambassadors of NATO countries, and defense ministers and military experts plan to discuss the issues. The Latvian foreign minister also drew attention to the fact that the allies supported Latvia's determination to increase its defense budget to 2% of the GDP. ""This removes certain tensions,"" he said. Asked whether the 1997 Founding Act on relations, cooperation and security between Russia and NATO binding the sides not to conduct noticeable movements of forces could obstruct the strengthening of allied presence Rinkevics pointed out to the resolutions of the NATO summit in Wales on increasing NATO presence in the Baltic states, Poland and Romania which followed the unification of Crimea with Russia. ""We are speaking of such actions that are related to the strengthening of defense. We are not speaking of things that are inscribed in the 1997 NATO-Russia document. Neither are we speaking of any termination of the 2002 Rome Declaration. Therefore we don't see absolutely any contradictions here. In any case the 1949 NATO Treaty stands above all other documents,"" he said. At the conference the foreign ministers of NATO countries also discussed questions of improving information exchanges with Russia realizing the need for communication channels to avoid various incidents to the utmost, the developments in Ukraine and relations with Russia, the NATO strategy in conditions of a hybird war.

Oct 30 (Interfax) - No materials related to the criminal investigation into the Maidan shootings of winter 2014 contain any direct evidence of the Russian security agencies' involvement in the events and the statements made by former chief of the Ukrainian Security Service Valentin Nalyvaichenko are no more than his own vision, head of the special investigations department of the Ukrainian Prosecutor General's Office, Serhiy Gorbatyuk, said. ""We have no direct evidence of the involvement [of the Russian security agencies] in the shootings.

The involvement of the Berkut special forces police regiment in the killings of protesters has been established, Gorbatyuk said, adding that now it is necessary to find out who exactly, driven by what kind of motives and acting under whose instructions gave the order to shoot. Within the scope of the probe, investigators are making efforts to establish how certain forces could contribute to such instructions being given to senior Ukrainian officials, Gorbatyuk added. According to reports, Nalyvaichenko claimed on Thursday that the Maidan shootings cases investigated by the PGO contained some data indicating the alleged involvement of the Russian security agencies and Russian senior officials in the events. He also said that ""the investigators will study this version"" and that ""the evidence is present in the case,"" but admitted that he cannot talk about any details, citing the secrecy of the investigation.

Margvelashvili and Usupashvili “discussed existing situation in the country and spoke about the importance of dialogue,” president’s office said in a brief statement. After the October 22 statement  in which he spoke of “prerequisites of civil confrontation and violation of constitutional order” and criticized PM Irakli Garibashviliâ€™s remarks  for adding tension to already difficult situation, President Margvelashvili held series of meeting with political parties, civil society and media representatives, and foreign diplomats. After his call for consultations was snubbed by the Georgian Dream ruling coalition, the President asked on October 23 for a meeting with the PM and the Parliament Speaker. Parliament Speaker Usupashvili also met on October 26 lawmakers from the opposition Free Democrats party. “Politicians should unequivocally and unconditionally denounce all forms of violence and contribute to civil accord,” Usupashvili said. Also on October 26, at a session of parliamentary bureau, lawmakers from the opposition UNM party raised before the Parliament Speaker the issue of the investigation, which was opened on October 24 by the State Security Service, into alleged coup plot. The State Security Service said that it launched investigation into “conspiracy to overthrow the government” based on unspecified “operative-investigative activities carried out by the counter-intelligence department and information reported in the media outlets.” The information in question is a reference to unsubstantiated text published by an obscure website, which claimed that ex-President Mikheil Saakashvili, who is now governor of Odessa region in Ukraine, was plotting with one of the leaders of UNM party, Giga Bokeria, attacks on Rustavi 2 TV personnel with a purpose to then trigger mass protests. Bokeria, who dismissed the report as “delirium”, was questioned by the State Security Service on October 24. UNM lawmakers told Usupashvili to intervene and find out details of this matter. The Parliament Speaker responded that it was beyond his competence to look into specifics of ongoing investigation, but also suggested that it will damage the State Security Service itself if it opened its investigation only based on dubious information in question. “I am convinced that it will become clear very soon if the investigation is based only on [the information] you have mentioned; if so then it will be, to say the least, extremely damaging for those people who have launched this probe based on that document,” Usupashvili said. “But it will also become known very soon if there is also some other basis for launching such investigation.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"[Computer selected and disseminated without OSE editorial intervention] Ulyukayev: extraordinary efforts needed to not introduce food embargo, non-preferential trade regime with Ukraine starting Jan 1 BRUSSELS. Dec 2 (Interfax) - The trilateral consultations between Russia, the European Union and Ukraine in Brussels on Tuesday did not lead to reaching the needed agreements, and experts were ordered to try to find acceptable solutions within a month in order to ease Russia's concerns about Ukraine's association agreement with the EU, but ""extraordinary efforts [will be] needed"" so that no food embargo and no non-preferential trade regime are introduced in relation to Ukraine, Economic Development Minister Alexei Ulyukayev told reporters after the negotiations. He said that the introduction of a food embargo against Ukraine is not related to the issues of association itself, but to the fact that Ukraine has joined sanctions against Russia. Ulyukayev also said that EU proposals to ease Russia's concerns are unacceptable for Russia, while Russian proposals have been only partially taken into account and this is clearly not enough. ""The discussion was fairly positive today. And if this conversation, and if the positions that we reached in mutual understanding had taken place a year ago, I would have thought that we were progressing well. But since we have a month left, of course the situation still causes concern,"" Ulyukayev said after the trilateral consultations with ministers from the European Commission and Ukraine. ""We considered several options for a possible agreement. In our view, what was prepared by our colleagues from the EU is unacceptable, primarily because these documents are not legally binding but consist of statements of willingness by the parties to find solutions to problems as actual harm is identified. But we're saying that it's late to resolve problems when harm has already occurred. We need to create a situation that will not allow such harm to occur. Therefore, we're saying that a legally binding structure needs to be formulated where each party would have its obligations,"" Ulyukayev said. He said that the association agreement between Ukraine and the EU that goes into effect on January 1 implies fundamental changes to the legal terrain. ""And the degree of obligations that Ukraine assumed toward Russia in our bilateral agreements and multilateral agreements within the context of the CIS decreases. They want us to agree to the degree to which the obligations of our Ukrainian partners decrease while maintaining our obligations concerning preferential trade with a zero customs tariff. We believe that this is not fair and economically detrimental. Therefore, we have presented our proposals, our version of this document, in which we took into account a great deal of what our European colleagues are proposing but included a mechanism of obligation - first we agree on the principles, and then we already form working groups that monitor, track how these risks materialize or don't materialize, and help in making decisions,"" Ulyukayev said. He also said that Russia has proposed specific mechanisms under which there would be a ""trilateral system of information exchange in the area of customs that would make it possible to track the origin of goods and close possibilities for goods from third countries to fall under the preferential trade regime between Russia and Ukraine."" ""We proposed maintaining the system of compliance certificates that Russian exporters now work with on the Ukrainian market, and the parallel functioning of two systems of standards - European standards that Ukraine is introducing at home and the standards that Ukraine needs to meet under CIS agreements, so that they be in effect side by side and businesses can choose. We proposed approximately the same thing in the area of sanitary and phyto-sanitary control,"" Ulyukayev said. He also said that, in the area of energy, Russia proposed maintaining the parallel operation of the Ukrainian and Russian energy systems, as well as wording that ensures an acceptable investment climate for Russian and Ukrainian companies - ""its non-deterioration, non-application of measures that discriminate against investors."" ""Our colleagues agreed with a lot of this. Nonetheless, there is no acceptable document yet and in our joint statement following the meeting we authorized experts to continue the work. We agreed to continue the work on both the expert level and at the ministerial level, but since there is little time left, some kind of extraordinary efforts will be needed in order to achieve agreement,"" Ulyukayev said. ""Nonetheless, we are proceeding from the assumption that the work will be conducted based on the draft that we presented. Our colleagues have taken an additional break for study. But we all need to understand that you can study as much as you want, but after January 1 we'll have to already study in a different economic reality,"" Ulyukayev said.

June 7 (Interfax) - The head of the legislature of the unilaterally proclaimed ""Donetsk People's Republic"" expressed the belief it was he who had been the target of the gun attack in the center of Donetsk on Saturday that killed one of his assistants. ""That was a political assassination. I had been traveling in that car quite often myself. There were two persons inside the car. One of them was my assistant Maxim, a deputy of the Supreme Council of the Donetsk People's Republic. His duties were humanitarian relief and supplies of drugs for Slovyansk and Kramatorsk,"" Denis Pushilin said. The bullet-riddled Toyota was provisionally left on the crime site, where detectives were at work, and some of the surrounding streets were cordoned off by traffic police, An Interfax correspondent reported from the site that the dead body also remained on the site. Two of the bullets had pierced the windshield. ""They confused him with me a little. I wore a suit the same color as his, and he had a beard, just as I do. Thank God, the other man who was in the car, one of our people, managed to leave the site of the attack. He jumped out and run away in the opposite direction. The situation is that the car stopped, for some reason, most likely because the computer inside had been switched off. It wasn't just an accidental attack. It had been planned,"" Pushilin said. When the vehicle stopped and the gunfire started, Maxim, who was at the wheel, told the passenger they ought to get out and dash off in different directions, and that is what saved the passenger, Pushilin said. ""After the latest bloody murders, any peace negotiations with the Kyiv government are out of the question,"" he said. Earlier, in reporting the assault, the press service of the ""Donetsk People's Republic"" told Interfax: ""On Pushkin Boulevard in the city center, not far from the Piramida cafe, the car of an assistant to Denis Pushilin, head of the Supreme Council of the Donetsk People's Republic, came under fire from an assault rifle. Maxim died on the spot."" The press service did not disclose the assistant's last name and just said he had been a Supreme Council deputy. However, the Ukrayinska Pravda newspaper named the victim in a tweet as Maxim Petrukhin. The Munitsypalna Hazeta newspaper also named him as Maxim Petrukhin and added that he had been aged 28 and born in Makiyivka. He had been a Donetsk City Council deputy, and Pushilin's humanitarian affairs aide, Munitsypalna Hazeta said. In testimonies contradicting Pushilin's words, witnesses said Pushilin and Petrukhin were standing outside a restaurant when more the 10 shots were fired at them from a car that was passing by.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A Moscow court arrested Ukraine's interior minister in absentia Wednesday, the Investigative Committee said in a statement.   Arsen Avakov is suspected of using prohibited means of warfare and killing civilians en masse during the Ukrainian government's campaign against insurgents in the country's east, the committee said.   Earlier the same court - Basmanny District Court - arrested in absentia the governor of Ukraine's Dnipropetrovsk region, Igor Kolomoisky, who is also accused by Russian investigators of organizing the mass killing of civilians. Russia has issued an international warrant request for the arrest of Kolomoisky and Avakov. The court rulings against the Ukrainian officials are widely seen as a political move, as Russia does not have the authority to detain foreign nationals outside Russian territory. Moscow has repeatedly condemned the military campaign being waged by Ukrainian troops against pro-Russian rebels in the country's conflict-torn east.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A swastika sign appeared on the building of the Ukrainian consulate in the city of Hrodna in the early hours of 21 May, the Belarusian independent Nasha Niva newspaper's website reported at 0926 gmt on 21 May. The employees of the consulate expressed their indignation at the act of vandalism and noted that nothing like this had happened in Hrodna since the start of the mass protests in Ukraine back in November 2013, when ""locals were bringing flowers and candles to the consulate building"" and expressed their compassion to the Ukrainians. The swastika was painted over later on 21 May and the consulate decided to purchase a video-surveillance device in near future. According to the newspaper, there is a memorial plate dedicated to the Belarusians of Jewish descent, who died during the WWII in Hrodna, on the other side of the same building which hosts the Ukrainian consulate. Local neo-Nazis have been vandalizing the plate several times in the last few years.

"A trucks of a Russian convoy carrying humanitarian aid for Ukraine. MOSCOW, September 13 (RIA Novosti) - The Russian Red Cross Society representatives are not accompanying the second convoy carrying Russian humanitarian aid to violence-torn eastern regions of Ukraine, Raisa Lukutsova, the head of the organization, told RIA Novosti Saturday. No escort, Lukutsova said, answering a question about whether the trucks are being escorted by the Russian Red Cross representatives. Earlier in the day, Russian customs officers confirmed that the customs procedures for all Russian trucks with aid for Ukraine were completed. On Friday, the self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic said that Moscow had formally notified it that the second Russian humanitarian aid convoy would arrive Saturday. The convoy includes 200 trucks that are carrying canned food, sugar, flour and other aid of a total weight of 1,880 thousand tons. The first convoy of 280 trucks carrying about 2,000 tons of Russian humanitarian aid was sent to eastern Ukraine in late August and entered the country through a checkpoint controlled by independence forces after spending more than a week waiting at the border. Residents of the conflict-ravaged Luhansk, who had been living for several weeks on the brink of a humanitarian catastrophe, greeted the aid delivery.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A view of Crimea Meshkov was elected as the President of Crimea on January 1994 winning more than 70 percent of the vote in run-off presidential elections. After winning the election, Meshkov promised to hold a referendum on Crimean independence in the spring of 1994. Furthermore, it was decided to make Russian the official language and introduce the ruble as the official currency in the peninsula, The New York Times reported in 1994. The Ukrainian government in Kiev, then led by Leonid Kravchuk, was not happy with Meshkov's endeavors. Meshkov was forced to cope with political terrorism and assassination attempts due to his political stance, which was unfavorable for the government in Kiev. The first Crimean president had to travel with two bodyguards armed with machine guns, according to a New York Times article from 1994. The people of Crimea were very much in support of the independence referendum in 1994. ""We need a change. Khrushchev gave the Crimea to Ukraine as a gift in 1954. You can give territory, any physical thing you like, but you can't give people. Crimea was and is Russian,"" an unnamed Crimean businessman was quoted by the New York Times. ""Russia has to help us somehow, give us rubles, something. After all, we're Russians,"" said Sasha Mochalko, a 21-year old police officer from Simferopol, as cited by the New York Times. Eventually, Meshkov was arrested and taken to the court. The government in Kiev did everything to bring chaos into the peninsula, soldiers were brought in, while Meshkov himself was removed from his post and the position of the president removed. The outspoken politician himself later had to flee and could only return to his native Crimea last year, when his life was no longer in danger. The New York Times article from 1994 gives a very different description of the situation: unbiased, objective journalism that back then the Western media was still capable of writing. The article's tone is that the Crimean people had a right for self-determination, as words, such as ""re-unification with Russia"" are used in the article.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"  The toppling of the elected government of Ukraine and the voting of the Crimean parliament – by 78 votes with 8 abstentions – deciding the day of referendum (16 March 2014) when Crimean voters will choose between joining the Russian Federation or to remain part of Ukraine as as an autonomous region with very strong powers, according to the 1992 constitution appears to be a reincarnation of the Cold War. The Cold War was a sustained state of political and military tension between powers in the Western Bloc (the United States with NATO and others) and powers in the Eastern Bloc (the Soviet Union and its allies in Warsaw Pact). Following the demise of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republic (USSR) on 26 December 1991, leading to the breakup into twelve republics, the US became the sole super power and marked the end of the Cold War. The energy sources of the Central Asian States, made them lucrative targets for influence by both the US and European Union as well as Russia. In the past two decades, Russia was in a weakened economic state to be able to assert its influence authoritatively but in the near past, the Russian bear has woken up from its hibernation and is vying for regaining control. Its moves into Abkhazia, Ossetia and Georgia virtually went unchallenged by the Occident, renewing Russian confidence. The current crisis in Ukraine came into effect because of a regime change forced by civil unrest and protests. Pro Russian troops control Crimea. According to a Russian-Ukrainian treaty signed in 2010, Moscow has an agreed and constant military presence in the Crimean peninsula. Russia pays Ukraine $97.75 million annually for use of the naval base in Sevastopol. Under the Russian-Ukraine agreement, Russia is permitted 25,000 troops in Crimea. If the Russian narrative is to be given credence, (based on a leaked telephonic boast by US spokesperson Victoria Nuland), in the last ten years, the US invested US$ 5 billion to effect a regime change and force the pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych to flee and be replaced by What Moscow regards as an illegal, neo-Nazi infiltrated government in Kiev, led by Prime Minister Arseniy ""Yats"" Yatsenyuk, an Ukrainian Jewish banker playing the role of Western puppet, who insists Crimea must remain part of Ukraine. Yet this ""government"" – supported by the US and the European Union – has already declared the March 16 referendum illegal. Yats has banned the official use of the Russian language in Ukraine; got rid of the communist party, which amassed 13% of the votes in the last election, more, incidentally, than the neo-Nazi-infested Svoboda (""Freedom"") party, now installed in key government security posts; and banned a Russian TV station, which happens to be the most popular on Ukrainian cable. The US narrative pleads that democracy-seeking protesters forced Russia's puppet president from office and are building a new government, which represents Ukraine's Western values. Meanwhile, the city council of Sevastopol – the headquarters of Russia's Black Sea fleet – has already voted to join Russia. And next week the Duma in Moscow will study a bill to simplify the mechanism of adhesion. EU is caught in the middle. Its energy resources as well as trade are dependent on Russia. The 9 billion euro (US$12.4 billion) Nord Stream between Russia and Germany via the Baltic Sea form its lifeline. Angela Merkel, the former Russian president Dmitri Medvedev, and former German chancellor and now Nord Stream chairman Gerhard Schroeder were instrumental in launching the pipeline project carrying Russian gas to Germany when it went online in 2011. Moreover, two-way trade between Russia and the EU was around a whopping US$370 billion in 2012, with Russia exporting mostly oil, gas and cereals, and the EU exporting mostly cars, medicine, and machine parts. US President Barack Obama has declared that the referendum in Crimea would ""violate international law"". Last Thursday he ordered sanctions on people responsible for Russia's military intervention in Ukraine, including travel bans and freezing of their US assets. Meanwhile, the US Defense Department has announced plans to add several fighter jets to US aircraft squadrons based near Russian borders, in a move to embolden the Baltic States and Poland. Sources indicate that the Pentagon plans to send six additional F-15 fighter jets, and a Boeing KC-135 refueling Stratotanker, to beef up the squadron of four F-15 currently flying air patrols over the Baltic States. NATO has been carrying out patrols in the Baltic States for the last 10 years. The threat of sanctions may backfire. Russia in solidarity and alliance with China has all the trumps in its court; Europe depends to 40% on gas supply from Russia, of which 80% passes through Ukraine; China holds about 1.6 trillion dollars of US debt it could drop and annihilate the US economy; that Russia, China, India, Brazil and South Africa – the BRICS – with almost 50% of the planet's population and about one third of the world's GDP will not be affected by the sanctions. Russia, on the other hand is reminding the US of its interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq and the US sponsored secession of Kosovo from Serbia in 2008. Moscow may not be bothered about Ukraine being promised a membership of the EU because the overwhelming majority of Europeans don't want it as part of their club. It would be concerned regarding NATO bases in Ukraine. Moscow might even compromise on Ukraine remaining a sort of Finland between Russia and Europe. With Crimea still inside the Ukraine, a NATO base side by side with the Russian base in Sevastopol would be nightmarish. While a US-Russia standoff continues to deepen a cold war like milieu, the crisis in Syria is likely to take a major hit. Russia is a guarantor in the destruction of Syrian strongman Bashar Al-Asad's arsenal of chemical weapons and any efforts to further widen the chasm between Russia and the US will directly affect the prospects of peace in strife torn Syria. The cold war is thus being revived.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Agency: Russian detectives ready go to Ukraine to test claim MH17 downed by Ukraine pilot MOSCOW. Dec 29 (Interfax) - Russia's Investigative Committee said on Monday it is ready to promptly send detectives to Ukraine to verify claims that MH17 may have been shot down by a Ukrainian air force jet. ""Representatives of the Russian Investigative Committee are ready to leave for Ukraine shortly with all necessary equipment for testing the pilot Voloshyn and all others who might know anything about the [crash],"" spokesman Vladimir Markin told reporters. Markin cited Ukrainian Security Service (SBU) spokesman Markiyan Lubkivsky as saying ""let them come here"" in a comment on an Investigative Committee offer to check Vladyslav Voloshyn on a lie detector. ""We have said repeatedly,"" said Markin, ""that we are open to any form of interaction, including with the Ukrainian side, in investigating the crash of the MH17 Boeing. It's just that our Ukrainian counterparts are showing an unsurpassed lack of openness and any desire to give any role in the investigations to anyone who seeks to find the true cause of what has happened and not to juggle facts to fit the official theory that serves the interests of Kyiv and the West."" ""So they're inviting us to Ukraine? We'll be glad if the SBU is as good as its word and organizes joint work of this kind. Our Malaysian partners shouldn't be forgotten either, though,"" the spokesman said. ""Now we're waiting for a response from the SBU - whether we ought to set off right now or wait till their supervisors' holidays are over,"" he said. Last week Markin told Interfax that Russian investigators had obtained evidence that MH17 had been shot down by a Ukrainian air force plane. ""The investigators didn't put off interrogations, and last night they were able to meet with a Ukrainian serviceman who confirms that he has voluntarily left his armed forces unit and came across to the territory of the Russian Federation,"" the spokesman said. ""According to the testimony of what is now a witness, whom a pseudonym has been given in the interests of his security, the Boeing 777 airliner of Flight MH17 might have been shot down on July 17 by [a Sukhoi] Su-25 combat aircraft of the Ukrainian air force that was piloted by Capt. Voloshyn of the Ukrainian air force,"" the spokesman said. ""The facts and information that the witness possessed and shared - clearly, without getting confused - convince the investigators that his testimony is truthful, something that, by the way, a polygraph test has confirmed,"" he said. ""As the witness may be in danger, the investigators are considering providing him with state protection under the witness protection program,"" Markin said. SBU spokesman Lubkivsky on Wednesday claimed that SBU investigations had overturned the allegations that MH17 might have been downed by a Ukrainian warplane were false. ""It has been found out that, in conformity with the plan for the counterterrorist operation, no aircraft from the Air Force … were used on July 17,"" Lubkivsky told a briefing in Kyiv. Moreover, data from the radar center in Dnipropetrovsk of the Ukraerorukh enterprise confirmed this, he said. Lubkivsky said Voloshyn did take part in the military operation in eastern Ukraine but that on July 17 he was on an airfield in Dnipropetrovsk. ""According to a report from the command of the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and military unit A4465, the above-named officer made no flights that day, and his aircraft was under repairs because of damage inflicted during landing on July 16,"" Lubkivsky said. The spokesman cited Voloshyn as saying he didn't know how the allegations about his possible attack on the Malaysian jet had found their way into the Russian media. ""Voloshyn claims that the photograph posted on the Internet had been taken during a flight show for the press in Mykolayiv [Ukraine] in summer 2012,"" Lubkivsky said. He added that Voloshyn's Su-25 was shot down on August 29 and that Voloshyn ejected, hid on militia-controlled territory for a while, and had never carried out any flight missions since then. Also on Wednesday, Markin urged Ukraine to make official records of July 17 hostilities available to Dutch or Malaysian investigators of the crash. ""It is an achievement already that the SBU admits that pilot Voloshyn exists. It is easy to check whether he flew on July 17 - just make the so-called journal of hostilities available to the Dutch authorities that are conducting the official investigation, or, better still, enable the same Dutch or, even better, Malaysian specialists to test Voloshyn, who, as we know now, does exist, on a polygraph,"" Markin said in a statement made available to Interfax. ""Neither would it hurt to question and test the traffic controllers who, for some unclear reason, took the Boeing off its route. But first of all, one would have to find them, Markin said. ""Clearly, all this is very difficult, or most likely impossible, to do. It's much easier to call the information and evidence that has been reported by the Russian Investigative Committee a fake,"" he said. The crash killed all the 298 people on board the Boeing, which was en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur. Among the victims were 196 Dutch nationals, 44 Malaysians, including the 15-member crew, and 27 Australians. There were also citizens of Indonesia, Germany, Belgium, the Philippines, Britain, Canada, and New Zealand among the passengers. International investigations have led to a tentative conclusion that the crash was caused by damage from an external source, most likely a missile. as",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Almost 2,000 people from Ukraine enter Belarus in past months - Lukashenko KLIMOVICHI, Mogilev region. April 28 (Interfax) - In the past months almost 2,000 people from Ukraine entered Belarus, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said. ""You know, this is the scariest thing when people leave and are forced to flee with their children. It is good that we take them. Where are people to go?"" Lukashenko said on Friday when addressing Klimovichi residents. According to the information by Lukashenko, ""literally 4,500 people entered Belarus and almost 2,000 of them are from Ukraine."" Ukrainian citizens are disoriented, Lukashenko has said in his address to the parliament and Belarusian citizens. ""The European Union proposes integration, Russia - federalization and they do not understand what the essence of the two is. Two forces are fighting and people are sucked into this trap. Ordinary people like you, who do not know what to do,"" the Belarusian president said. ""Some are calling for barricades, others are given arms - go and shoot. Shoot who? Our people, own brothers?!"" he said. The Belarusian president said he could not ban entry to Belarus, but they are watching who is coming. ""Families, it is clear. But criminals could rush here too. We have enough of those and can barely cope,"" he said. Belarus is concerned about the situation in Ukraine, Lukashenko said. ""And the worst is yet to come,"" he said.

"Ambassador: Ukraine crisis settlement is EU chair country Latvia's priority MOSCOW. Jan 22 (Interfax) - Latvian Ambassador to Russia Astra Kurme hopes that Latvia will promote the peace process in Ukraine in the capacity of the EU chair country. ""Hopefully, the Ukraine crisis settlement will be progressing in the period of our presidency and we will be contributing to that as much as we can,"" she said at a press conference at the Interfax central office on Thursday. ""The resolution of other problems will not begin until then,"" the Latvian ambassador added. ""As long as the EU and Russia have not reached [consensus] over such important matters as security in Europe, it will be very difficult to speak about something else,"" she noted. ""Yet, I would like to assure you that Europe and Russia need one another.

"Another humanitarian aid convoy formed in Rostov Region MOSCOW (Sputnik) - Russia's 38th humanitarian aid convoy for residents of Ukraine's troubled southeast (Donbass) is heading for the Donetsk and Lugansk regions, a spokesperson of the Russian Emergencies Ministry said early on Thursday. ""At 04:00 Moscow time [01:00 GMT] the Russian Emergencies Ministry convoy with humanitarian aid for Donbass left the [Russian] Donskoy rescue center in the Rostov region,"" the spokesperson told journalists. At the border with Ukraine the convoy vehicles will split into two groups, one of which will head to the southeastern region of Donetsk, while the other one will go to Lugansk. The convoy consists of over 100 vehicles that are carrying over 1,200 metric tons of aid including food, such as flour, tea and grains, as well as school and university textbooks for Donbass students. The Donetsk and Lugansk regions have been severely affected by fighting between Ukrainian troops and Donbass independence supporters, which started in April 2014 when Kiev launched a military operation in the region. Overall, Russia has sent more than 45,000 metric tons of humanitarian aid to Donbass since August 2014. In November 2014, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko ordered to impose an economic blockade on Donbass, withdrawing all state-funded health, educational and social protections from the region. Earlier this week, the Russian Foreign Ministry stressed that Kiev must avoid any actions that could lead to the deterioration of the humanitarian crisis in Donbass, stressing that the bombardment by Kiev-led forces and the restrictions on cargo transit and water supplies across the line of contact between the conflicting sides were the main triggers of the humanitarian crisis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ant this document to stipulate gas purchases by Ukraine, injection into underground storage, the volumes and the obligations of the European side, which would assume responsibility to provide financial assistance, because, you understand, there [in Ukraine] there is a problem now with money to pay for gas to inject into underground storage facilities, Novak said. The meeting will most likely be held after June 20. Pipeline proposals Elsewhere, Novak spoke of plans for various pipelines. Russia has not received official proposals about participation in the Eastring gas pipeline project for now," Novak said. """"The European Commission is considering various options. We are waiting for proposals. For now", no official proposals on participation in the project have come to us," he said. The Russian minister added that this project is expected to join the Turkish Stream: """"There is such a proposal."""" Russia and India are discussing the possibility of a joint project to build a gas pipeline to India"," Novak said. """"At a meeting with my Indian colleague we discussed various projects", including a joint project to build a gas pipeline to India," he said. Novak also said he had met with Saudi Arabia's oil minister and discussed cooperation between the countries in the oil sphere. """"Saudi Arabia is considering investment in Russia", he said, adding that the sides had agreed to form a technical commission to look at the issue. Meanwhile, Russia and China plan to write guarantees by China to boost the capacity of a branch of the Eastern Siberia-Pacific Ocean (ESPO) pipeline on its territory to 30 million tonnes," Novak told reporters. """"The agreement contains this figure", 30 million tonnes, nobody's changing it. There are plans to adjust the agreement, given that China needs these three years, and to write guarantees by China to build its section of the pipeline by a certain time, Novak said. He said nobody as altering China's commitments to take up 30 million tonnes. MOSCOW. June 3 (Interfax) – Gazprom is to submit claims against Ukraine's state-owned oil and gas company Naftogaz Ukrainy in Stockholm arbitration seeking over $8 billion in penalties under take-or-pay contract provisions for 2014, Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller said during the annual European Business Congress. He said Ukraine's total debt to the Russian gas giant is now pushing $30 billion, including debt for gas supplies to Donbas. Ukraine said the latter issue will be taken up in the framework of regular trilateral talks, with a source telling Interfax the next round would be held in Brussels next week. Turning to European exports, Miller said Gazprom will supply more gas to Europe this year than it did in 2014, with deliveries in May 5% higher than in the same months last year, and that Gazprom's share of the European market is also set to grow. He said Gazprom is confident that Europe's dependence on gas will grow and that the Russian gas giant does not have any competitors in covering Europe's gas needs within a radius of 10,000 km. Ukrainian claims Gazprom will submit claims against Naftogaz Ukrainy and file in Stockholm arbitration to recover $8.197 billion for gas Ukraine is liable to pay for under take-or-pay contract provisions in 2014, Miller said. Naftogaz Ukrainy said it welcomes plans by Gazprom to hand its claims against the Ukrainian company over to arbitration," the Ukrainian gas monopoly has said while commenting on the statements of Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller on the new claims against Naftogaz. """"Arbitration is the most civilized way of settling commercial disputes", if the sides fail to find consent via negotiations, reads the report, citing Naftogaz CEO Andriy Kobolev. Miller said Naftogaz's total debt amounted to $29.477 billion. In this sum is included the debt for gas supplies, penalties for take-or-pay, and also for gas supplies to Donbas. So, for today, Miller said, the debt for gas supplies to Donbas is $200 million. Miller noted that between the sides there was an understanding about not resorting to levying fines for take-or-pay in the framework of the winter package of agreements [reached in October 2014], however this is not elaborated upon before these agreements. Naftogaz's debt to Gazprom for gas supplies to Donbas is $200 million, Miller said. Gazprom estimated the gas supplies to the territory not under control of the Ukrainian authorities in Donbas at 555 million cubic meters for $174.2 million. Ukrainian Energy and Coal Mining Minster Volodomyr Demchyshyn said that the issue about payments for gas supplied to Donbas will be taken up in the framework of regular trilateral talks. Ukraine is not pumping enough gas into underground storage," Miller said. """"It is pleasing that current consumption has risen three times compared with April. But the pace of injections is insufficient. Quite definitely not enough to pump in the required volumes in order to make it through the winter without risk", he said, adding that Ukraine needs to inject 18 billion cubic meters of gas into underground storage. The meeting on gas supply at the level of experts at the trilateral EU-Russia-Ukraine negotiations will be held in Brussels on June 2," a source in the EU institutions told Interfax on Friday. """"It will be a purely technical meeting in a trilateral format", the source said. The Russian and Ukrainian energy ministers and EU officials will hold consultations on the gas topic in the second half of June, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak told journalists. There has been no decision concerning a discount on the price of Russian gas for Ukraine," he said. """"We will discuss this at the end of June", he said. Elsewhere, Moscow is proposing that the new package of gas agreements that might be signed following a trilateral meeting between Russia," Ukraine and the European Commission include the stipulation that Ukraine must purchase gas for injection into underground storage facilities and that the EU provide financing for that purpose. """"We would want this document to stipulate gas purchases by Ukraine", injection into underground storage, the volumes and the obligations of the European side, which would assume responsibility to provide financial assistance, because, you understand, there [in Ukraine] there is a problem now with money to pay for gas to inject into underground storage facilities, Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Wednesday in Vienna, BBC reported. The meeting will most likely be held after June 20. Ukraine injected 1.777 billion cubic meters (bcm) of gas into underground storage facilities in May 2015. Ukraine had 10.201 bcm of gas in underground storage as of May 31, Ukrtransgaz reported. It was reported earlier that Ukraine began withdrawing gas from underground storage for the 2014-2015 winter season on October 20,2014, when it had 16.750 bcm in storage. When the withdrawals ended on April 10,2015, there were 7.609 bcm in storage. Ukraine has 12 underground storage facilities with capacity for about 31 bcm. They and the gas pipeline network are operated by Ukrtransgaz. European exports Gazprom will supply more gas to Europe this year than it did in 2014, with deliveries in May 5% higher than in the same months last year, Miller said. Gazprom's share of the European market is also set to grow, Miller said. Market share at the end of 2014 amounted to 30% of EU gas consumption," he said. """"Gazprom has an even greater share of EU imports: two-thirds right now. That is a very large amount"," he said. """"According to our estimates", gas consumption in gas generation of Europe may increase by 12%. In the near future, a revaluation of the role of coal on the European market will take place. And such decisions are completely near at hand, Miller said. Interfax calculations on the basis of data of neighboring gas transportation operators that Gazprom exported 13.6 billion cubic meters (bcm) to non-CIS countries in May, which is only 3.9% higher than what was exported in May 2014. For the 5M of 2015 the exports have fallen by 10.6% to 61.7 bcm. The company all the same cannot correct the failure to supply for the first two months of this year, when the concern was involved in a dispute with gas reserves in Ukraine, which limits supplies to European clients. Gazprom is confident that Europe's dependence on gas will grow and that the Russian gas giant does not have any competitors in covering Europe's gas needs within a radius of 10,000 km. Gazprom accounted for two thirds of the European Union's gas imports and 30% of its gas consumption in 2014," Miller said. """"And the share of imports on the European market will only increase. In the past 15 years the share of imports has grown by 17%", and in the next 15 years it will grow by a comparable amount," Miller said. """"And therefore the question: from where", from what sources will Europe get gas? At one time the European market put hope in liquefied gas, but Europe has lost the battle for LNG, Miller said, noting that the share of LNG in Europe has shrunk to 17% from 30%. LNG will not play a major role in Europe in the near future," he believes. """"And this is not only a question of prices", but a question of the competitiveness of Russian gas. And Iran has said that it is giving priority to production of LNG and shipments to Southeast Asia. We don't have any competitors in gas shipments within a distance of up to 10,"000 km from the European market. There are none!"""" Miller said. """"According to our estimates", gas consumption in gas-fired generation in Europe could increase by 12%. In the very near future there will be a reassessment of the role of coal on the European market. And such decisions are not far off at all," Miller said. He also said that Europe has contracted 30% of the current level to 2030. """"And the issue of contracting is an issue that is absolutely in demand. Particularly since 15 years is even less than our usual long-term contracts - 20-30 years"," Miller said. He recalled that 75% of regasification facilities in Europe are now sitting idle. """"There are also such questions in regard to pipeline gas", Miller said. He also commented on other gas supply projects in Europe. The Eastring project does not yet have a feasibility study or a set of participants, and negotiations have not been held with possible gas suppliers," he said. """"And the question of whose gas will end up in this gas pipeline is significant", Miller said. The Eastring project, which is being discussed by Slovakia, Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania, could connect the eastern point of the Ukrainian gas transport system (Velki Kapushany) and the Romanian-Bulgarian transit line. Commenting on the TAP gas pipeline from Azerbaijan to Europe," Miller said that four years ago the participants in this project planned to start shipments in 2017. """"Now they're talking about 2021", and every year for four years a year is added. And experts say that this trend of adding a year will continue, Miller said. Gazprom does not expect to face a substantial financial penalty in the EU antitrust case now underway, a Gazprom source told journalists. Asked by journalists about the possible size of the judgment," the source said: """"If there is any"," I don't think it will be large."""" The European Commission began the official investigation into Gazprom's potential violations of EU antitrust law on August 31", 2012. On April 22,2015, the European Commission sent Gazprom a statement of objections outlining the alleged violations of EU antitrust law based on investigation. Gazprom has three months to respond to the allegations. It can also demand a court discussion where it can spell out its arguments, the European Commission said. The violations consist in part of Gazprom stipulations that the gas it delivers not be re-exported. The European Commission maintains that this enables Gazprom to set unfair prices for some EU member states. Gazprom is also abusing its dominant position on the market, making gas supplies conditional on obtaining unrelated commitments from wholesalers concerning gas transport infrastructure, the European Commission said. Gazprom has a market share of over 50% in the majority of Central and Eastern European countries and 100% in some cases, the European Commission said. Chinese talks Elsewhere, Miller will hold a new round of talks in Beijing on June 2. For that reason, Miller will not attend the World Gas Conference in Paris," Gazprom spokesman Sergei Kuprianov told Interfax. """"In this situation", our priority is clear, he said. The Turkish Stream gas pipeline project, including detailed information on the technologies that will be applied and the project logo, will be on display at the World Gas Conference, he said. MOSCOW. June 1 (Interfax) - Gazprom exported 13.6 billion cubic meters (bcm) to non-CIS countries in May, which is only 3.9% higher than what was exported in May 2014," according to Interfax calculations on based on data from neighboring gas transportation operators. Gazprom spokesman Sergei Kupriyanov confirmed these calculations. """"According to adjusted data", growth in supplies to non-CIS countries in May 2015 grew 3.9% compared with the same period of 2014," he told reporters. """"In May", the dynamics of supplies to Europe varied, with Western Europe showing significant growth and growth in demand slowing in Central and Eastern Europe. Supplies to Western Europe in the period grew 11%, with Germany showing the biggest growth," he said. Gazprom chief Alexei Miller at the end of last week that May exports would grow more than 5%. """"The figures aired at the European Business Congress Gazprom supplies to the non-CIS in May 2015 were preliminary and corresponded to information as of the middle of that month", Kupriyanov said. For the 5M of 2015, the exports have fallen by 10.6% to 61.7 bcm. The company is still unable to make up the shortfall for the first two months of the year," when it tried to battle reverse gas supplies to Ukraine by limiting supplies to European clients. MOSCOW. June 2 (Interfax) - Gazprom is ready to conduct settlements with China for gas supplied via the so-called 'Western Route' for both yuan and rubles. """"The currency of the contract is being discussed. We haven't yet dotted all the i's. But we are prepared to conduct settlements in both yuan and rubles", Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller told the Rossiya 24 TV channel following a latest round of talks in Beijing. Miller said that at the latest round of talks," the sides """"penciled in a schedule of works and expressed their intention to speed up the project"""" to supply gas to China via the Western Route. This project includes a plan for shipping up to 30 billion cubic meters (bcm) of gas per year to China from existing fields in Western Siberia. Gazprom and China's signed an agreement on pipeline gas supplies via the Western Route on May 8. MOSCOW. June 1 (Interfax) - Gazprom redeemed 1 billion euro in 10-year notes on Monday"," the Russian gas giant's press office told Interfax. """"Gazprom honored its obligations to redeem 1 billion euros in Eurobonds on time and in full", the company said. The 5.875%-notes were placed on June 1, 2005. The placement organizers were ABN Amro Holding and Credit Suisse First Boston. The notes were issued by Gaz Capital S.A. (Luxembourg). Gazprom currently has $23.116 billion worth of Eurobonds outstanding. PARIS. June 3 (Interfax) – German oil and gas company Wintershall Holding GmbH has said still sees Russia as a priority in its operations. However, CEO Mario Mehren told reporters in Paris that the current economic and political situation is complicating investment in the country. As an example, Mehren pointed to the called-off BASF/Wintershall asset swap with gas giant Gazprom, but said his company could return to the deal in future should the political climate change. Wiintershall still has plans through 2018 to invest about 500 million euro in existing projects in Russia, he said. Elsewhere, the company, once an active partner of Gazprom in the South Stream gas pipeline project, is skeptical about the successful full-scale implementation of its Turkish Stream successor, saying European consortiums are unlikely to want to invest in extending the project past the Bosphorus. Meanwhile, Wintershall is mulling with Gazprom ways of unblocking capacity on the OPAL pipe. Priority market Russia, given the scale of its oil and gas reserves, remains a priority for Wintershall, but the current economic and political situation complicates investment in the country, Mehren said. Gazprom spent years preparing a deal to swap assets with BASF/Wintershall, but at the last moment in December 2014 the companies called off the deal under pressure from difficult political situation. However, Mehren said Wintershall is prepared to return to the deal if the political climate changes. The issue is not being discussed at the moment because the political conditions remain the same as last December, but if the situation improves, Wintershall is always willing, he said. Mehren said that even now he sees opportunities for the development of foreign companies' business in Russia. Wintershall plans to invest about 500 million euro in existing projects in Russia - Achimgaz, Yuzhno-Russkoye and Volgodeminoil - in the period to 2018, Mehren said. The company has also invested fairly heavily in the past, including 200 million euro in 2014, he said. But the fact remains that many possible investments in Russia are complicated by two factors: sanctions and the downturn in the Russian economy, and it is very difficult to make investments in such a market, Mehren said, adding that this is why he has said that this is a situation where both sides lose. Europe's energy security can only be ensured with Russia, Mehren said. This is not a geopolitical fact, but a geological one, and therefore Russia will continue to play an important role in Western Europe's energy supplies, he said. Turkish Stream Wintershall is skeptical about the successful full-scale implementation of its successor Turkish Stream, Mehren said. Gazprom plans to build four lines of the Turkish Stream pipeline across the Black Sea from Anapa to the European part of Turkey with combined capacity of 63 billion cubic meters. The capacity of the first line is expected to cover the needs of the Turkish market and the subsequent lines are intended to supply gas to the European market, replacing current transit shipments through Ukraine. Mehren said that Gazprom will probably build one or two lines in order to increase exports to Turkey, but said he is skeptical about the prospects of creating a hub in Turkey to distribute gas to countries in southern and southeastern Europe, because he does not see consortiums that would be willing to invest in this project. The difficulties with which construction of onshore sections is fraught were already apparent when Wintershall was involved in the South Stream project, Mehren said, adding that he has little optimism or confidence about the creation of consortiums that would build the pipeline through Macedonia and Greece. The same is true about the prospects of finding companies that would be interested in the near future, and this problem is not so much Gazprom's but Europe's as well, because Europe needs a pipeline like South Stream, Mehren said. Commenting on statements by Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller about the change in the paradigm of cooperation with Europe and the emphasis on the East, Mehren said that Miller, as the head of the company, probably needs to look at new markets. And European countries are constantly saying that they need less Russian gas, so it's understandable that Gazprom is talking about diversifying exports, he said. But the fact remains that Europe is a very important market for Gazprom, because it offers the best prices and reliable customers, Mehren said. OPAL capacity Wintershall and Gazprom meanwhile are thinking about how to revive the process of unblocking the capacity of the OPAL gas pipeline, the onshore branch of the Nord Stream offshore pipeline from Russia to Germany. New requests have not been submitted to regulators to lift the provision on using the capacity, Mehren told reporters. The companies are thinking about how to get this process moving and are trying to talk to participants in this process, Mehren said, adding that they are working daily to get things moving. However, the whole situation with Ukraine is not conducive to making a decision on OPAL, he said. Only 62% of OPAL's annual capacity of 36 billion cubic meters is currently used. Back in 2009, European regulators stipulated that if Gazprom or its trading joint venture Wingas reserve more than 50% of capacity at the border with the Czech Republic, a gas release (auction to resell gas transported along the pipeline) of 3 bcm per year (10% of the pipeline's capacity) would be required. This would have essentially meant Gazprom conceding half of its share of the Czech market. Gazprom refused the gas release, so it was partially barred from using OPAL. But the Russian gas giant has de facto already lost the whole Czech market, as at the beginning of last year Gazprom and RWE agreed to temporarily suspend shipments on their contract. Supply increase Elsewhere, Germany Wingas, a joint venture between Gazprom and BASF/Wintershall and one of the biggest players on the European gas market," does not expect LNG supplies to Europe to increase due to the decline in global prices for that commodity. """"A large share of LNG contracts are tied to the price of oil and the price level in Asia and demand remains high. For that reason", given low prices, demand in Asia will likely rise. For that reason, I do not believe large volumes will be supplied to Europe," Wingas CEO Gerhard Koenig told journalists """"Pipeline gas supplies are covered in long-term contracts and are tied to the price of oil", he said," adding that there was little connection between volumes and price. Koenig does not expect LNG to be a major factor in Wingas' portfolio. """"Half of our portfolio consists of contracts with Gazprom and half we purchase on the European market or from North Sea sources", but we have no long-term LNG contracts, he said. Increases in gas imports will be possible thanks to Russian gas, he said, adding that Russian pipeline gas is competitively priced, as witnessed by the spare capacity at LNG terminals. Wingas plans German gas trader Wingas has no plans to sell its European gas storage subsidiary, astora," Koenig told journalists. """"We are not planning to sell astora", Koenig said when asked by an Interfax correspondent. Wingas and astora were to have been transferred to the full control of Gazprom under the asset swap agreed by the Russian gas giant and BASF/Wintershall. But the deal was canceled and those enterprises remain under the joint control of the Russian and German partners. In other news, the Russian representation of Wingas will relocate to St. Petersburg along with Gazprom Export, a Wingas representative told Interfax. The Russian representation of the JV is currently located at Gazprom Export's offices on Strastny Boulevard in Moscow. It will move to Gazprom Exports offices on Ostrovsky Square in St. Petersburg. The official opening of the representation will be held next week, the Wingas representative said. PARIS. June 2 (Interfax) - French Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne has confirmed that the goal of Yamal LNG shareholders is to agree project financing by the middle of the year. If they don't succeed, the shareholders will continue to finance the project independently and will not suspend operations, Pouyanne said at a press conference held in conjunction with the World Gas Conference. The Yamal LNG project will cost an estimated $27 billion. The shareholders in the project - Novatek with 60% and Total and Chinese CNPC each with 20% as of April - have invested about $10 billion so far (including 75 billion rubles from Russia's National Welfare Fund (NWF)). The shareholders expect to receive another 75 billion rubles from the NWF in the second quarter. Novatek chief Leonid Mikhelson said in April that signing of binding documents on receipt of project financing was expected in the first half of the year and the Yamal LNG already had confirmation from export credit agencies on readiness to guarantee $5 billion. Earlier Pouyanne said that the project participants were working to raise $10 billion-$15 billion in euro or yuan from Chinese banks. European gas supplies Pouyanne spoke out against politicizing Russian gas supplies to Europe. Pouyanne said Russia was in first place in the world in terms of gas. A lot of politics is involved because Russian gas is supplied to Europe through Ukraine, he said at the World Gas Conference in Paris. Pouyanne favors compromise and diplomatic solutions, given that Russia is an important business partner for Europe, he said. Pouyanne also said that Europe will increase renewable energy sources, but that the role of non-renewables will nonetheless remain significant and should not be opposed. In addition, Pouyanne expressed concern for CO2 emissions due to rising use of coal in power generation, noting that gas would reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Schwedt Refinery Elsewhere, Rosneft may move ahead in the deal to purchase a stake in Germany's Schwedt Oil Refinery from Total already this month," Pouyanne said. """"Come to the forum in St. Petersburg and find out everything", Pouyanne said," answering a question about where the deal is in the sale of a 16.67% stake in Schwedt Oil Refinery to Rosneft. """"Total and Rosneft signed a Term Sheet that envisages the main terms and conditions of the purchase of 16.67% share in a refinery located in Schwedt", Germany (PCK Raffinerie GmbH), Rosneft said in November. Total and Rosneft also agreed on the supply of products to Total's retail chain and wholesale consumers. PCK Raffinerie GmbH refinery was founded in 1958 in the city of Schwedt/Oder in German Democratic Republic and was designed with the technical support of the USSR. The completion of the construction of the trunk oil pipeline Druzhba made the supply of crude oil and the launch of the enterprise in 1964 possible. The enterprise was privatized in 1991. At present, the primary distillation capacity is 11.5 million tonnes a year. Nelson index - 9.2. Shareholders are curently 37.5% Ruhr Oel GmbH (ROG), 37.5% Shell, 16.67% Total, 8.33% Eni. The refinery has a sea terminal in for accepting oil in Rostock and also a distribution terminal for petroleum products in Seefeld close to Berlin. MOSCOW. June 3 (Interfax) - Anglo-Dutch Shell is offering to independently invest in the project to build a third train of the Sakhalin LNG plant," Energy Minister Alexander Novak said in an interview with Rossiya 24 television. """"Overall Shell is offering its investment in the project [Sakhalin-2] expansion", Novak said. A final decision on expanding the LNG plant's capacity has yet to be made, he said. Novak met with Shell representatives on Wednesday. Questions surrounding construction of the third train of the Sakhalin-2 LNG plant were discussed at the meeting. The Sakhalin-2 project's LNG plant, Russia's only full-scale LNG plant," will shut down for scheduled maintenance in June. """"The work is scheduled to begin in mid-June and continue for 28 days"," project operator Sakhalin Energy said in the corporate publication. The comprehensive shutdown will affect all Sakhalin-2 facilities: """"the LNG plant", the trunk pipeline system, the booster station (BS)," the onshore processing facility and the Lunskoye-A gas production platform."""" """"The organizational-technical readiness is currently being checked", contracting companies are being mobilized, materials are being delivered, and preparations for temporarily taking equipment out of service have begun, the publication says. The Sakhalin-2 project involves development of the Piltun-Astokhskoye and Lunskoye fields, located on the Sakhalin shelf, with recoverable reserves of 150 million tonnes oil and 500 billion cubic meters gas. The shareholders in Sakhalin Energy are Gazprom (50%), Royal Dutch/Shell (27.5%), Mitsui (12.5%) and Mitsubishi (10%). Sakhalin Energy produced 10.8 million tonnes of LNG in 2014. The 2015 production target is 10.5 million tonnes. PARIS. June 3 (Interfax) – Rosneft is continuing to hold talks with Alltech Group, the owner of the Pechora LNG project, about joining the project for the production and liquefaction of gas. Rosneft Vice President Vlada Rusakova told Interfax that Rosneft is planning to buy 50% plus one share of Pechora LNG and then will subsequently increase its stake in the project to 100%. Alltech denied ever holding talks with the state-controlled oil major on the sale of the asset, saying it is merely seeking a partner. Meanwhile, Rosneft has suspended talks on the purchase of Norilsk Nickel-controlled Taimyrgaz, but remains interested in it, Rusakova told Interfax. Answering a question about whether or not price of the asset was a reason for the slowdown in talks," she said: """"Cheaper would be desirable."""" Pechora Rosneft is continuing to hold talks with Alltech Group about joining the Pechora LNG project for the production and liquefaction of gas. """"For Pechora LNG we are working out an agreement. We had an agreement signed at a high level", we are developing a framework agreement, where all principles, several questions remain there, for example, options that we have not agreed upon," Rusakova told Interfax. She said that at present Rosneft is planning to buy 50% plus one share of Pechora LNG and then will subsequently increase its stake in the project to 100%. """"We want to buy it [all] to the end. All the option terms and conditions have been agreed upon. The discount for this option has not been finally agreed upon because some formulas were made", so that we received a discount on this option because the project has a certain cost of growth, and it will build up due to all the movements on this project. The sum of the deal has not been definitively agreed upon, it is moving depending on the changes in market conditions, now the initial sum has basically been agreed upon for the acquisition, the further development," Rusakova said. Rusakova explained the gradual increase of Rosneft's stake in Pechora LNG by saying that the current owner of the project """"has no desire to leave the project."""" """"But in the end", I think [Rosneft will buy] 49% also, the Rosneft vice president said. Alltech Group however claimed it has never held talks with Rosneft on possible sale of the LNG project," but rather is seeking a partner for the project. """"Alltech Group is not considering the possible sale of a 100% stake in the Pechora LNG project. The company's main goal is to bring in partners and to further develop the project. Alltech Group has never held talks on complete sale of the project. Options on purchase of 100% were not discussed", Alltech President Dmitry Bosov told Interfax. Alltech Group and Rosneft signed an agreement on the creation of a joint venture for the implementation of a gas project in May 2014 in the framework of the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum. Then it was reported that Rosneft would receive a 51% stake in the project. For a year the companies did not manage to close the deal, but Rosneft has confirmed its interest in the project. The project involves hydrocarbon extraction at the Korovinskoye and Kumzhinskoye fields in Nenets autonomous district, processing of output at a gas treatment plant, condensate refining into diesel fuel and construction of a gas liquefaction plant. However, the company has yet to settle on the amount of capital investment in the project, which is currently estimated to total $5.5 billion-$12 billion, depending on the various construction options for the LNG plant and its capacity. The company is considering two options for the plant: with capacity to produce 4 million tonnes or 8 million tonnes. Pechora LNG is the only LNG project in Russia not included on the list of LNG exporters under the liberalization of LNG exports that took effect on December 1,2013, prompting the company to seek a partner to carry out the project. Taimyrgaz Meanwhile, Rosneft has suspended talks on the purchase of Taimyrgaz, but remains interested in it, Rusakova told Interfax. In October of last year the Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) approved the petition of LLC Val Shatskogo, which is a Rosneft subsidiary, to buy a 51% voting stake in gas company OJSC Taimyrgaz," which is controlled by Norilsk Nickel. Rusakova told Interfax: """"We have not filed any applications", we simply discussed [this], we have a field nearby - we wanted to develop synergy. We already have a lot that was worked out [advanced], but now it has been suspended somewhat," because the times are such."""" Answering a question", about whether or not price of the asset was a reason for the slowdown in talks," she said: """"Cheaper would be desirable. We have not finished talks"," simply slowed them down slightly."""" Rusakova said that of the gas assets of Norilsk Nickel (Norilskgazprom and Taimyrgaz)"," Rosneft is interested in the second: """"No"," we only talked about Taimyrgaz."""" Norilsk Nickel is not commenting on the progress in negotiations with Rosneft. The company did not name a possible price for gas assets. Norilsk Nickel owns Taimyrgaz and Norilskgazprom", a 38% stake of which it recently bought from Gazprom for 1.3 billion rubles, which the company is planning to merge. The confirmed gas reserves of the single company are 317 billion cubic meters (of which 199 bcm are at the Pelyatkinskoye field). This company may produce 13-17 bcm a year, while the needs of the Norilsk industrial district are met with 3 bcm a year. The gas assets do not have access to the united gas supply system. According to company materials, the development program for gas assets is estimated at up to $1.5 billion for a period of up to 5-10 years to join them to the pipeline. Norilsk will not invest in the gas business as a non-core asset, it is planning to sell the assets. In a recent report on Norilsk Nickel, Credit Suisse estimated the company's gas assets at about $300 million. UBS, comparing the Norilsk gas assets with other Russian gas assets, which have access to a trunk pipeline, estimated them in their current state at $1 billion. Far East LNG The prospect of relocating Rosneft's Far East LNG project from southern Sakhalin Island to the Khabarovsk port of De-Kastri will not affect the timetable for the project's implementation," Rusakova told Interfax. """"The site there was worked within the context of Sakhalin-1. Exxon and our company have many materials", because we planned to build a terminal there and some other installations, in other words, we have all the surveys, but this will not seriously postpone the project, Rusakova said. When asked if the company will be able to launch the LNG plant in 2019 at the new location," Rusakova said: """"We're also looking at external conditions: at the market", at prices, at all these things," which is why we have a flexible schedule that we are working by. We're supposed to begin working on FEED B [the second phase] for one and the other site this year; we had the first stage of the FEED. We're now discussing with ExxonMobil when it's best for us to begin so as to do the marine surveys."""" Rosneft planned to build the LNG plant at the southern end of Sakhalin Island", where Sakhalin Energy has an existing LNG plant (part of the Sakhalin-2 project). The gas fields for supplying both LNG plants are located at the northern end of the island. Because Sakhalin Energy has refused to provide access to free capacity on the existing pipeline, Rosneft has considered different sites for the planned LNG plant. One likely site is in the vicinity of De-Kastri, Khabarovsk territory, where Rosneft has an oil terminal. Rosneft asked for access to up to 8 billion cubic meters of pipeline capacity a year (equivalent to about 5.8 million tonnes of LNG). The oil major planned to complete construction of the LNG plant, with capacity for 5 million tonnes a year, by 2019, initially in a joint venture with ExxonMobil and then under the Sakhalin-1 production-sharing project. In 2014, Rosneft said LNG to be produced by the plant's first phase had already been contracted. The biggest volume - 2.75 million tonnes - was sold to Vitol, Marubeni is buying 1.25 million tonnes and Sodeco - 1 million tonnes. Investment in the project is expected to total $6.5 billion-$8 billion. Gazprom had previously held long-running talks with Sakhalin-1 operator ExxonMobil on purchase of associated gas for the Sakhalin-2 project. MOSCOW. June 2 (Interfax) - A Sistema partnership structure is the owner of LNG-Gorskaya LLC, which is the operator for construction of a complex to produce liquefied natural gas (LNG) in St. Petersburg, according to the SPARK-Interfax database. A 100% stake in LNG-Gorskaya is held by CJSC Laminei, which has held stakes in Sitronics, MTS Bank, Sistema Management Company LLC, and other Sistema-controlled companies. LNG-Gorskaya's website names Sistema as one of the partners in the project. A Sistema spokesman declined to respond to an Interfax question concerning the corporation's ties to the project. LNG-Gorskaya issued a press release on Tuesday saying it had signed a contract with United Shipbuilding Corporation (USC) on construction of the first LNG carriers in Russia. USC will build three LNG carriers, each with capacity for 7,300 cubic meters. The contract is worth 5.67 billion rubles. The carriers will take 22 months to build. The contract also provides an option to build six bunkering LNG carriers. The LNG-Gorskaya projects will see construction of a floating LNG plant with capacity to produce 1.26 million tonnes of LNG (1.968 billion cubic meters of gas) a year, a fleet of nine bunkering vessels, piers, loading docks, a gas pipeline and organization of several LNG bunkering terminals abroad: in Finland, Germany and Sweden.

(3/6) PARIS. June 3 (Interfax) - BP welcomes the possibility of Rosneft acquiring a new Russian shareholder, but in any case it does not have a big enough stake in the Russian state oil major to influence the decision, the British oil and gas company's CEO, Robert Dudley told reporters. Asked how he felt about the possibility of a Russian company, such as oil firm Surgutneftegas, acquiring a stake in Rosneft, Dudley said this would be wonderful, but that BP's stake would not enable it to influence this decision and this would not depend on BP at all. Sberbank president German Gref believes that reports that Surgutneftegas, the Russian oil company with the biggest cash pile," might buy a state stake in oil major Rosneft are not true. """"I don't want to comment on this at all. As far as I know", this was a big hoax, Gref said in an interview with business daily Vedomosti published on Thursday. Reports that Surgutneftegas, which had 1.9 trillion rubles in liquid assets at the end of the first quarter of 2015, might acquire a 19.5% stake in Rosneft within the context of privatization appeared in the media in the first half of May. Surgutneftegas said the reports were unfounded. However, a source close to Rosneft, although he called the reports surprising," said that the company was interested in acquiring """"stable domestic investors"""" such as Surgutneftegas. Asked what would happen if Surgutneftegas", the biggest corporate client of state banks, decided to withdraw its money," Gref said: """"We don't have a problem with dependence on one depositor"," no matter who it is."""" """"We're capable of returning deposits to any client - in December we returned with such speed and so unexpectedly that with Surgutneftegas", if a situation arises, we'll manage to reach an agreement somehow, Gref said. BP owns 19.75% of Rosneft. The Russian government plans to sell a stake of about the same size - 19.5% - within the context of privatization. Bloomberg, citing sources, reported that this stake could be acquired by Surgutneftegas, which has the biggest cash pile of any Russian company. Taas-Yuryakh Rosneft are discussing the possibility of acquiring a 20% stake in LLC Taas-Yuryakh Neftegazodobycha from the Russian state oil giant, Dudley told Interfax. Dudley said BP was in talks with Rosneft on the joint development of several conventional onshore oil fields. They are not in direct talks on Vankorneft," but they """"are talking about other things", he said. Asked whether he meant a stake in Tass-Yuryakh," Dudley said: """"Right."""" In October 2013", Rosneft concluded a series of deals on the acquisition of a total of 65% of LLC Taas-Yuriakh Neftegazodobycha, bringing its stake to 100%, and it also bought the main part of the financial liabilities of the object. According to a Rosneft report, the total cost of the acquisition of 65% was $2.053 billion (66 billion rubles). The enterprise holds licenses for the Srednebotuobinskoye field, which is located 169 kilometers from the Eastern Siberian-Pacific Ocean pipeline. An oil pipeline was built from the field to Eastern Siberia-Pacific Ocean (ESPO) pipeline near the city of Lensk. In the state register there are more than 134 million tonnes of C1+C2 recoverable reserves of oil and gas condensate as well as more than 155 billion cubic meters of gas. Oil production at the field began in October 2013. BP's Dudley told Interfax a frame agreement had been signed in December and that work was ongoing. Perhaps an agreement will be reached by the time of the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum," but """"nothing has been finalized yet", Dudley said. He said it was better not to talk about a sum, but that the estimate was a big one. Dudley said he thought Rosneft was talking to other companies about joining the project. He said it was better to ask Rosneft," """"but I think other companies will join us if we reach this agreement", he said. The Kommersant newspaper said in December that BP was buying about a 20% stake in Taas-Yuriakh Neftegazodobycha from Rosneft in a deal worth an estimated $700 million-$800 million. Output Elsewhere, BP aims to boost gas to 60% of hydrocarbons output in the next ten years, from 50% this year, Dudley said. Dudley called in his speech to the congress for power companies on use more gas in order to cut carbon emissions. He also said that after sanctions against Russia are lifted, BP will certainly resume discussing projects with Rosneft to tap difficult oil reserves. MOSCOW. May 28 (Interfax) - Rosneft is planning to bring its level of oil production at projects in Venezuela to 8 billion tonnes by 2019 from 1.6 million tonnes in 2014 (about 4% of the country's total oil production)," Rosneft said on its website. Rosneft CEO Igor Sechin met in Caracas with Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on May 27. """"The parties discussed a wide range of issues of current cooperation and prospects of developing new projects", it said on the website. For 2010-2014 Rosneft's investments in joint ventures in Venezuela amounted to $1.8 billion rubles. Rosneft has also offered to buy some of PDVSA's interest in PetroMonagas and boost its stake in the joint venture to 40%, the Venezuelan company said. TNK-BP, which Rosneft took over in March 2013, bought 16.7% of PetroMonagas in 2011. PDVSA owns the other 83.3%. PetroMonagas produced 8.3 million tonnes oil equivalent in 2013. PetroMonagas develops oil and gas fields in the eastern Orinoco basin. The project with PetroMonagas involves extracting and enhancing the quality of super-viscous oil and the production and sale of synthetic crude. Rosneft is participating in the implementation of five production projects on the territory of Venezuela. In particular the projects are: Carabobo-2,4 (JV Petrovictoria, PDVSA - 60%, Rosneft- 40%), Junin-6 (JV PetroMiranda, PDVSA - 60%, LLC NOC - 40%), JV PetroMonagas (PDVSA - 83.3%, Rosneft - 16.7%), JV Boqueron (PDVSA - 60%, Rosneft 26.67%, OMV - 13.33%), JV Petroperija (PDVSA - 60%, Rosneft - 40%). The total geological reserves of oil of these projects are estimated at more than 20.5 billion tonnes. Elsewhere,Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak discussed issues of bilateral cooperation with Venezuelan People's Minister of Petroleum and Mining Asdrubal Jose Chavez Jimenez. The Russian Energy Ministry said that in the framework of the ministerial meeting, special attention was paid to the work of Russian companies in Venezuela," in particular in the field of oil production. The parties also discussed the situation on global oil markets and cooperation in the gas and electricity spheres. """"I am convinced", that joint products being implemented and those being worked out on the territory of Venezuela will facilitate the strengthening of the strategic partnership between our countries, Novak was cited as saying in the ministry's statement. The next meeting of OPEC will take place on June 5 in Vienna. Analysts expect that the organizations will keep quotas on production at the previous level - 30 million barrels a day. MOSCOW. June 3 (Interfax) - Rosneft is forming a business plan without account of the funds of the National Welfare Fund (NWF)," a company representative told Interfax. """"A positive decision on the allocation of NWF funds would lead to an acceleration of the implementation of the company's projects", the applications for which are under review at the Russian Economic Development Ministry," the representative said. """"The company is creating its business plan without account of NWF funds", because the applications are under review, the source said. The source said the company's financial state is stable and balanced in the framework of the adjusted business plan that was confirmed by the board of directors in April. Five projects were selected: an infrastructure project for the Zvezda shipbuilding cluster, Rospan gas project, Angarskaya Petrochemical Company, the Russkoye and Yurubcheno-Tokhomskoye fields - these projects are providing a total budget effect of 6.73 trillion rubles," the company representative said. """"The specific timeframes for the Russkoye and Yurubcheno-Tokhomskoye fields are dictated by the obvious production logic", which is understood by any specialist in the sector, this is seasonal work on projects and the transport of materials and equipment in the Far North, this is the complex technological aspects of movement along winter roads, short navigation, plant logistics and the mobilization of contractors, the source said. The Economic Development Ministry and the Energy Ministry have approved part of Rosneft's applications for the receipt of money from NWF, five priority projects. With the selection of these projects, it was expected that the sum to be allocated for financing them from the NWF would be 300 billion rubles. Earlier Deputy Economic Development Minister Nikolai Podguzov said that Rosneft would ask for 1.3 trillion rubles from the NWF for 28 projects. MAGADAN. June 2 (Interfax) - OJSC Rosneft and Statoil are planning in June 2016 to conduct the first drilling of maritime exploration wells on the Magadan shelf outside the limits of the twelve-mile zone of the Sea of Okhotsk. The press service of the Magadan customs service said that this issue was discussed at a meeting with representatives of OJSC Rosneft and Norway's Statoil," who came to the regional center. """"The operators LLC Magadanmoreneftegaz and LLC Lisyanskneftegaz were established by two companies - OJSC Rosneft and Statoil - for drilling prospecting and appraisal wells in the northern part of the shelf of the Sea of Otkhotsk. The first drilling is planned to take place in June 2016", and at present, preparations are being made for the start of work, the Magadan customs service said in a statement, the leadership of which also took part in the meeting. The press service said that for carrying out drilling work, the use of foreign technologies and materials is envisaged. At the meeting, oil producers were interested in issues connected with logistics and also the possibility of conducting customs control in shortest possible amount of time. This is the second visit to Kolyma of the companies' representatives: in 2014 specialists in logistics, aviation, environmental protection, drilling and safety came to Magadan to evaluate the possibility of using local resources when implementing oil and gas projects. Earlier in its report, Statoil said that it received certain permits from the Norwegian authorities for continuing its participation in joint projects with Rosneft, however it must receive permission for funding and future development. The company said that a number of types of activities, in relation to which Norway, the EU and United States introduced sanctions against Russia, are impacting Statoil's business in Russia. MOSCOW. May 29 (Interfax) – Russia's biggest independent oil producer, Lukoil, is anticipating fall changes to Russian legislation that will finally allow private companies access to the Russian shelf. Lukoil, which has ambitions to enter the Arctic, believes anything other than a positive decision would be illogical, company President Vagit Alekperov said during an interview on Rossiya 24 television channel. In the interview, he also said he does not expect OPEC member countries to reduce oil production quotas at their upcoming meeting in Vienna next week. He also spoke of a number of Lukoil's foreign projects, telling the channel that Lukoil anticipates that its Karpatnaftokhim petrochemical plant in Ukraine will resume operating and that it expects its legal dispute with Sinopec over sale of a production asset in Kazakhstan will be settled soon. Elsewhere in Central Asia, Lukoil plans to quadruple gas production in Uzbekistan by 2018, and in Iraq Lukoil has recovered $3.7 billion of the $5.7 billion it invested in the West Qurna 2 project in Iraq, Alekperov said. Shelf access Lukoil is expecting that in the autumn the changes to legislation will be drafted, which will allow private companies to work on the Russian shelf, Alekperov said. He said that the work of the Natural Resources Ministry, Energy Ministry," statements of deputy prime ministers say that relevant materials are being prepared. """"I hope that in the autumn it [the bill] will be presented. And the government will present it to the presidential administration"," he said. """"Lukoil is a Russian national company: our influence on the social life in the regions is enormous", our impact on the forming of the budget is enormous. Plus to all the licenses that are given by the state for the right to explore and develop, which is controlled by the state, prescribe the entire responsibility of the investor. Therefore I think that national security will not be harmed in any case if Lukoil carries out geological exploration, and in the future, the development of fields located on the shelf," Alekperov said. """"We think that in the near future this issue will be discussed and it will find its own resolution", because it is illogical today to not make a positive decision," he said. """"Why are we trying to enter the Arctic? Because the tax base today is formed", understandable and predictable, he said. The Natural Resources and Environment Ministry plans to submit to the government the entire set of updated criteria for oil company access to shelf operations at the beginning of June," ministry head Sergei Donskoi told journalists on the sidelines of the Nevsky International Ecological Congress on Friday. """"Internal coordination"""" of the updated criteria is currently underway"," Donskoi said. """"The government has already examined our proposals once [prior to their updating]. The outcome was the government instruction to update the document for a host of criteria. On Wednesday [the updated proposals] were distributed to all the colleagues - the associated government bodies", the Energy Ministry the Economic Development Ministry," he said. """"For now there has been no feedback. Next week the colleagues ought to provide their commentary concerning the new criteria", he said. Donskoi did not say when the government would examine the updated proposals," saying only that """"the final decision will come later."""" OPEC quotas Alekperov said he does not expect OPEC member countries to reduce oil production quotas at their upcoming meeting next week. """"I don't think", and analysts don't forecast that OPEC will reduce quotas," Alekperov said. """"Today OPEC countries face a fiscal problem. There is after all a fairly tense political situation in these countries", huge resources are needed, including to acquire weapons. Therefore, production volumes will remain at the same level. No one, of course, will increase them so as to dramatically reduce oil prices, but neither will they reduce, Alekperov said. Oil prices in the next three to five years will not exceed $75 to $80 per barrel," Alekperov said. Karpatnaftochim restart Lukoil anticipates that its Karpatnaftokhim petrochemical plant in Ukraine will resume operating. """"We are continuing consultations with the Ukrainian government on a resumption of Karpatnaftochim's operations"," Alekperov said. """"I am confident that the situation in Ukraine will stabilize", he said. Lukoil is ready to restart the plant, when the situation surrounding Russian companies in Ukraine stabilizes," he said. """"I believe that such a plant should be operated by the specialists at the highest level. An asset that we possess should produce benefits", for the Ukrainian people among others, Alekperov said. Karpatnaftochim, in Kalush, Ivano-Frankivsk region, halted production of ethylene, polyethylene, vinyl chloride, caustic soda, chloride and suspension PVC in September 2012 due to the poor market for petrochemical output. Production of suspension PVC resumed in November 2014. Last year, Lukoil agreed to sell 240 filling stations in Ukraine to Austrian AMIC Energy for $300 million. It only closed the deal recently. Sinopec dispute Lukoil anticipates that its legal dispute with Sinopec over sale of a production asset in Kazakhstan, Caspian Investment Resources Ltd, will be settled soon," Alekperov said. """"We currently have a misunderstanding on how to move the project forward. We signed a contract", set out the price, sold our asset. Unfortunately, the price changed, we understand, but we all need to uphold our contractual obligations," he said. """"Consultations are currently underway. I am confident that we will settle this misunderstanding in the near future"," Alekperov said. """"We will most likely suspend the litigation - I am not saying we will cancel it - for the negotiating period", which should bring us to a mutual understanding. We are two major companies. We will continue to cooperate on the global market. For that reason, we need to reach a settlement on these issues, he said. Lukoil filed for arbitration procedures in London in February 2015 seeking recovery of damages from Sinopec, which decided against buying 50% of Caspian Investment Resources, which has stakes in four hydrocarbon production projects in Kazakhstan. Lukoil argues that Sinopec is in breach of the sales contract worth $1.2 billion that was signed on April 15, 2014. Sinopec already owns 50% of Caspian Investment Resources. Caspian Investment Resources, via a number of joint ventures, owns a 50% stake in projects to develop four Kazakh fields: Alibekmola and Kozhasai (ownership shared 50-50 with KazMunayGas); North Buzachi (with China's CNPC), and Arman (with Shell, 50%). It also owns 100% of the project to develop the Karakuduk field. Lukoil's share of output from those projects totaled 10.2 million barrels of oil equivalent in 2013. This spring, the Russian-Chinese inter-governmental commission urged Lukoil and Sinopec to settle the dispute out of court. Uzbek gas Elsewhere in Central Asia," Lukoil plans to quadruple gas production in Uzbekistan by 2018. """"We're currently producing 4 billion cubic meters per year. In 2018 we will be producing about 16 bcm", Alekperov said. All of the gas produced as part of the projects in Uzbekistan is sold to state company Uzbekneftegaz, which ships almost all of it to China," Alekperov said. """"We are completely receiving the funds that are allowing us to carry out a stable investment policy"," """"We are building a credit line with Korean banks for financing our gas project on the territory of Uzbekistan", Alekperov said. Lukoil is working in Uzbekistan in the framework of a production sharing agreement (PSA) for the Kandym-Khauzak-Shady block, which envisages the production of natural gas in southwestern Uzbekistan. Production at the Khauzak section began in the fall of 2007. In November 2014, Uzbek President Islam Karimov has approved a $2.662 billion contract between LLC Lukoil Uzbekistan Operating Company, Lukoil's subsidiary in Uzbekistan, and South Korean Hyundai Engineering Co. Ltd. to build a gas processing plant (GPP) and equip the Kandym group of fields. The first phase of the Kandym GPP will be launched by July 1, 2018. In addition Lukoil is implementing the Southwest Gissar project in Uzbekistan. The amount of investments in the project is more than $1.2 billion, and the level of gas production is 4.2 bcm a year. At the end of 2011, gas production began for the Gissar project. Lukoil is also participating in a project to develop the Aralsky block in Uzbekistan. Earlier Lukoil planned by 2016 to produce no less than 18 bcm of gas a year in Uzbekistan. Iraqi ROI Lukoil has recovered $3.7 billion of the $5.7 billion it invested in the West Qurna 2 project in Iraq," Alekperov said. """"I hope that this year we'll compensate all historic expenditures [and] begin to earn a profit. In other words the project is effective", Alekperov said. Lukoil is working on West Qurna 2, the world's second largest undeveloped oil field with reserves of about 14 billion barrels, under a service contract. Lukoil has a 75% stake in the project and Iraqi state company North Oil Company holds 25%. Lukoil intends to bring production at the field up to 400,000 barrels per day in 2015. The field is expected to plateau in 2017. There are plans to invest $26 billion in the project over ten years. Korchagin investment Elsewhere, Lukoil is keeping the planned amount of investments for 2015 in the Korchagin field in the Caspian at the level of 10 billion rubles," LLC Lukoil-Nizhnevolzhskneft Deputy CEO Alexander Zverev said at a meeting of the investment board of the Astrakhan regional government. """"The substantial change of the exchange rate of the dollar and the reduction of prices for oil on global markets will lead [for 2015", according to the forecast] to a reduction of revenue by 24% and of net profit by 29%. However, despite the fall of global prices for oil, the introduction by Western countries of restrictions on Russian companies' access to financial markets, the company will guarantee its announced investment programs. As was planned for 2015, investments in projects will amount to 10 billion rubles, he said. According to the materials of the government, the profitability of oil sales, produced at the Korchagin field, will amount to 26% in 2015. Zverev said that the project of developing the field was presented an especially important status by the regional government," which is being kept until the end of 2015. """"At present", more than 4.5 million tonnes of oil have been produced at the field. The timeframe for returns on the project is four years: from 2012 until the end of 2015. The volume of investments for this period will amount to 34 billion rubles for this period, the production volume - 5.4 million tonnes of oil, he said. According to the materials of the Astrakhan regional government," the implementation of the project of developing Korchagin field for 2015 will allow Lukoil-Nizhnevolzhskneft to post revenue in the amount of 30.2 billion rubles. """"In the last several years revenue figures of the company have had a positive performance", the materials said. The total spending on production and product sales in 2015 will amount to 6.9 billion rubles, net profit - 11.1 billion rubles. Lukoil began production at Korchagin in spring 2010. The field, discovered by Lukoil in 2000, has 3P hydrocarbon reserves of more than 270 million barrels of oil equivalent. Maximum production will be 2.5 million tonnes of oil and 1 bcm of gas per year. Lukoil's second project in the Caspian will be the launch of the Filanovsky field," which the company discovered in 2005. It was reported earlier that this field has C1+C2 recoverable reserves of 153.1 million tonnes of oil and 32.2 billion cubic meters of gas. MOSCOW. June 2 (Interfax) – Lukoil chief Vagit Alekperov has told parliamentary hearings in the State Duma that he believes tax breaks for all fields on the shelf should be in effect for a longer period of time. He said that the tax maneuver in the oil industry will not boost the profitability of fuel and energy companies in today's macroeconomic situation and that his company is in favour of keeping the institute of the consolidated taxpayer group and lifting moratoriums on including new organizations in already created groups. He also said that Lukoil suggests extending mineral extraction tax (MET) concessions for the Caspian by another decade. Taxes Alekperov said he thought tax breaks for all fields on the shelf should be in effect for a longer period of time. """"I'm talking about legislation for the shelf as a whole. Due to existing constraints", we are unable to make use of that period that has been allotted today, that is, five years. Today I made a proposal and we've started to discuss it: in general, for the whole law on shelf development, we should extend this period from five to 10 years," Alekperov told reporters. He said these proposals were being discussed with the energy and finance ministries. """"Their position is so far reserved", he said. The tax maneuver in the oil industry will not boost the profitability of fuel and energy companies in today's macroeconomic situation," Alekperov said. He said the situation with the tax maneuver in the oil and gas industry was an example of the instability of taxation in the fuel and energy sector. """"On the one hand", the tax maneuver could have a positive effect on the level of oil production. On the other, it can't be said that profitability in the fuel and energy sector is rising in the current macroeconomic situation, he said. Alekperov said upstream growth had been offset by a downstream decline, and that a volatile ruble had complicated investment programs. Lukoil is for keeping the institute of the consolidated taxpayer group and lifting moratoriums on including new organizations in already created groups, Alekperov said. He said that the consolidated taxpayer group is providing tax revenue to the regional budgets, it is an additional impetus for the development of their investment attractiveness. Also," one cannot ignore the fact that the consolidated taxpayer group and legislation on the transfer of price formation makes it possible to balance the system of taxation. """"Under the existing conditions we think that it is necessary to keep the acting system of tax payments on profit for consolidated taxpayer groups", changing only certain elements of the system, refining it, Alekperov said. Caspian Lukoil suggests extending MET concessions for the Caspian by 10 years, Alekperov said. He said that a number of fields being developed at present have MET concessions," however the specification of the timeframes of their development and change in foreign conditions poses a question about the extension of the validity of concessions. """"In the first place", I am speaking about the projects for which the drop in oil prices was a sensitive issue. These include subsurface sections, fully or partially located on the sea shelf, in particular, in the Caspian. For them it is necessary to extend the MET concessions, at a minimum of 10 years from the moment of field going on stream, Alekperov said. Lukoil plans to spend 62.5 billion rubles on construction of the Filanovsky field in the Caspian Sea in 2015," Lukoil-Nizhnevolzhskneft LLC said in materials. """"In November 2014 the facilities for the first phase of construction of the Filanovsky field were positioned at sea. Construction work continues there. Plans for 2015 are to absorb 62.5 billion rubles", the materials say. Spending on construction of the field will total 102 billion rubles. This year Lukoil plans to install the living quarter platform (PMZh-1), complete the first stage of construction and installation work on the ice-resistant stationary platform (LSP-1) to enable a start to drilling, and complete the first stage of construction and installation work on the riser block (RB). Construction and installation work on the central processing platform (TsTP) is also scheduled to be completed in 2015, with startup operations under load being conducted in 2016. Commercial operation of the first stage at the field is slated for 2016. Also in 2015, plans are to continue building second phase facilities (LSP-2 and PMZh-2), for installation at the offshore site in 2016. Construction work continues on the head onshore facility (GBS) in Kalmykia, where oil from the field will be accepted for further transportation. The GBS includes a tank farm with capacity for 80,000 cubic meters to ensure uninterrupted acceptance of oil from offshore fields, a pump station, oil treatment facilities, a commercial hub for metering volumes and monitoring quality, a fire fighting depot and crew quarters. So far four oil tanks with capacity for 20,000 cubic meters have been built. Elsewhere," Alekperov plans to meet with the Iranian and Iraqi oil ministers in Vienna. """"Yes", I'll be in Vienna. I have a meeting there with the oil minister of Iraq and the oil minister of Iran, Alekperov said, when asked whether he would be traveling to the Austrian capital for the next OPEC meeting on June 5. MOSCOW. June 2 (Interfax) - Gazprom Neft in the framework of a program for winter oil supplies from the Novoport field has exported seven tankers of Novy Port oil with a total volume of more than 110,000 tonnes. All of the crude was sold to consumers in northwestern Europe with payment in Russian rubles, the company said in a statement. Gazprom Neft CEO Alexander Dyukov, who was cited in the press release," said: """"We are continuing to develop unique technical", logistical and marketing solutions for the Russian oil and gas sector, which permit us to not only reach year-round commercial development of the Novoport fields but also to increase the share of export transactions in Russian rubles, Dyukov said.

May 29 (Interfax) - Russneft will be able to convert its debt to Glencore once the Swiss commodities trader has obtained a 46% stake in the Russian oil company. """"There'll be nothing left outstanding", Russneft's founder and board chairman, Mikhail Gutseriev, told reporters, when asked whether Russneft would still be in debt after the deal to transfer a 46% stake to Glencore closes. He said Russneft owed Glencore nearly $1 billion. He also said he had invested $947 million in the company himself. Reports have said Glencore would receive 49% of Russneft's parent company," but this was later lowered to 46%. """"We just did the proper reckoning", that's all, Gutseriev said," commenting on the decision. He did not say when the deal might close. """"Again", it depends on the authorities, we got permission calmly. Nobody's rushing anywhere, he said. The Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) has cleared Rambero, a firm affiliated with Glencore, to obtain the 46% of Russneft. But Glencore has said the deal was in no way connected to the conversion of Russneft's debt to the trader. It was previously reported that Glencore and Russneft prolonged talks last year on converting at least $900 million in debt into Russneft shares to 2015. Russneft refinanced a portion of its debt owed to Glencore in December 2013," paying $1 billion. The parties agreed to adjust the terms of their debt agreement by adding a requirement of converting at least $900 million in remaining debt into Russneft shares in 2014 depending on the final results of a valuation and due diligence. Gutseriev did not say when Russneft might be fully amalgamated with Neftisa. """"Why Rush? Big things are best done slowly. We'll see what the situation in the market", the economy is, how oil rises or falls, what happens to the ruble. It's a combination of factors affecting serious things, a merger between two large companies, he said. A year ago, during the international economic forum in St. Petersburg, Gutseriev said he planned to merge the companies in the middle of 2015. Glencore might have a 15%-20% stake in the merged company, he said on May 28. He said Neftisa had reserves of more than 300 million tonnes of oil and produced 7 million tonnes a year. Gutseriev has said he valued the merged company at $18 billion. ST. PETERSBURG. May 28 (Interfax) - The conditions being imposed on Schlumberger's purchase of shares in Eurasia Drilling Company (EDC) do not stipulate any intra-corporate monitoring arrangement, Federal Anti-Monopoly Service (FAS) chief Igor Artemyev told Interfax on Thursday. Asked about the arrangement for intra-corporate monitoring of the deal," Artemyev said: """"There isn't one at all. Interference in the business operations of organizations", all the more so for complex, intricate organizations, where there are foreigners," must be ruled out."""" In other words"," the company has two options: """"either you work the way you know how to work - and they know how to work well - or", if any unfavorable conditions take shape, someone imposes sanctions, sell the stake in the Russian company, he said. The conditions that Schlumberger must accept do not include a golden shares, which the FAS considers to be excessive, he said," without disclosing details of the deal. """"We will publish them. I do not have the right to voice them. This is currently an internal government document. But I want to say that Schlumberger agreed all these conditions and there is nothing terrible in that", he said. EDC and Schlumberger have agreed to extend the deadline for their deal by another month, until June 30, as they continue to wait for approval from Russian regulators, EDC said. Schlumberger has agreed to buy 46% of EDC and might subsequently consolidate 100% of the company. The deal requires the approval of the government commission for foreign investment. The government commission has agreed to the deal on condition that Schlumberger comply with a number of conditions. They have now been agreed with the Federal Anti-Monopoly Service (FAS), the company and relevant government agencies. FAS deputy head Andrei Tsarikovsky said the main condition for the government to approve the deal is that Schlumberger must agree to sell all assets in Russia to Russian investors if it should leave the country. The meeting of the government commission for foreign investment at which the conditions of Schlumberger's purchase of the EDC stake will be considered may be held before mid-June. MOSCOW. May 28 (Interfax) - Rostec intends to establish its own service company for directional drilling, Viktor Kotov, deputy CEO of Neftegazavtomatika, the Russian state corporation's oil, gas and energy technology center, told Interfax. He said Rostec wants to tap into the growing market for directional drilling services by buying rotary steerable systems (RSS) from the market leader in Russia," U.S. oilfield services company Baker Hughes. """"But ultimately our goal is to localize directional drilling services and technology for manufacturing rotary steerable systems in Russia", Kotov said. He did not specify how many RSS Rostec plans to buy. The financial model of the project is linked to the sale of oilfield services, he said. Kotov said the market cannot be offered something untried when everyone has already become accustomed to a certain level of service," but it would take three to four years to develop Rostec's own systems from scratch. """"Therefore", our idea is to ultimately do reverse engineering without violating the patent rights of western companies if, of course, we don't reach an agreement with the rights holder on localizing RSS production technology in Russia with the transfer of a license for production, Kotov said. He said that in Russia the Elektropribor research institute is trying to develop such systems and Permneftemashremont provides some services, but there is no major Russian player on the directional drilling market. Major foreign players on the directional drilling market in Russia are Halliburton, which has announced a merger with Baker Hughes, and Schlumberger. Kotov said an agreement with Baker Hughes has not been signed yet, but negotiations are being held and the issue is being cleared with the Industry and Trade Ministry. Initially, Baker Hughes specialists could be used on an outsourcing basis, and in future they could be hired on a permanent basis, Kotov said. ASTANA.

June 1 (Interfax) - Kazakhstan has abandoned the idea of establishing a gasoline availability stabilization reserve," Deputy Minister of Energy Uzakbai Karabalin said. """"Many countries are now trying to keep gasoline to themselves. We have also given a thought to this idea. To be honest", we have discussed this issue a few times, as to how to insure and protect [gasoline availability on the domestic market], including the creation of a [gasoline availability stabilization] reserve. In the end, we arrived at a conclusion that we do not need the reserve," Karabalin said at a Monday parliamentary hearing in Astana. """"According to the government resolution all [domestic] refineries have to have a specified volume of gasoline stock to prevent any shortage of gasoline on the domestic market", he said. Kazakhstan generally needs 200,000 tonnes a month. Actual stocks currently exceed that amount. The Energy Minister said earlier that it might create an Ai-92 gasoline reserve. Kazakhstan experienced a fuel shortage in 2014 that forced state bodies to boost fuel imports from Russia and other countries and to raise the retail price ceiling on Ai-92 gasoline. TASHKENT.

June 2 (Interfax) - The construction of the gas pipeline for accepting gas from the Power of Siberia trunk pipeline by China has already begun," and the official ceremony for the welding of the """"first joint"""" will take place already this month"," Gazprom said after talks of Gazprom chief Alexei Miller and China's Senior Vice Premier of the State Council Zhang Gaoli and CNPC Chairman Wang Yilin. """"Work on the Russian section is going according to schedule. Last week the construction of the gas pipeline for the acceptance of gas from Russia officially began in China", and the welding of the first joint is scheduled for the end of June, the press release said. The meeting participants discussed in detail the progress of talks on gas supplies to China via the Western route and the schedule of future activities for preparing for the signing of a contract. Miller," who was cited in the statement after the talks said: """"The signing of a contract on the Eastern route created a solid foundation. In talks on the Western [route]"," we are moving forward at a good rate. The important stage is the signing of the main conditions for the Western route. The fixing of exact coordinates of the crossing of the border finally and unambiguously defined the corridor of supplies both for the first 30 billion cubic meters of gas from Western Siberia and for following [supplies]."""" A year ago", on May 21,2014, Gazprom and CNPC signed an agreement on the purchase and sale of gas along the Eastern route. The agreement was concluded for 30 years and envisages the supply of Russian gas to China in the amount of 38 bcm a year. The Western route envisages the supply of gas to China from fields of Western Siberia in the amount of 30 bcm of gas a year. On May 8, 2015 Gazprom and CNPC signed an agreement on the main conditions of pipeline supplies of natural gas from Russia to China along the Western route. YAKUTSK. June 2 (Interfax) - Gazprom said it was working with contractors on the most stringent terms," but keeping them alive. """"We're being very stringent with our contractors", extremely so. We're literally squeezing every last bit of juice out of them," Gazprom Deputy CEO Valery Golubev told reporters in Yakutsk. He said Gazprom's budget committee was scrutinizing all agreements with the contractors and contracts and """"calculating the costs objectively."""" He said there """"must be nothing to spare"""" in the costs of these contractors"""" but at the same time"," """"the contractors shouldn't die a death while performing these very works."""" Power of Siberia Asked about the high margin on a Sakhatransneftgaz contract to clear the route for a section of the Power of Siberia pipeline"," Golubev said he thought the general contract and the subcontract might have been signed at in different economic conditions. """"Of course there are some factors at play here: maybe something has changed in the cost of materials", then there are inflationary processes, or come kind of works might not have been taken into account, Golubev said. He said the authorities of Yakutia had high demands for Gazprom where environmental legislation was concerned, and that, too," could have influenced the difference in the cost of the contract. """"Yegor Borisov [the head of Yakutia] is making rigorous demands of Gazprom", he says work as year-on-year will, but make sure you take environmental issues into consideration first of all," Golubev said. """"We have a lot of experience of work in West Siberia - the Yamal", Tyumen. It's cold enough in Siberia, but in Yakutia, with its permafrost, the conditions are totally different. And we have already felt this in the first two or three years. You have to use explosives to lay routes, he said. Sakhatransneftgaz's margin to clear 93 km of the Power of Siberia pipeline's route was almost half the price of the contract. Sakhatransneftgaz sub-contracted a local firm, LLC Mass, to clear the route from Lensk to the Saldykelskaya compressor station. The general contract was worth 112.1 million rubles including VAT, and 52.9 million rubles will be paid on the subcontract, a difference of 47%. Sakhatransneftgaz and LLC Mass are not commenting on the situation, nor is the client," LLC Gazprom Transgaz Tomsk. """"A million dollars - you know", that's not a lot of money for Gazprom, Golubev said. Not subject to disclosure Gazprom considers it impossible to publicly discuss the cost of the first and so far only contract to be awarded under the Power of Siberia gas pipeline project," which CJSC Stroytransgaz received on a no-bid basis. """"You know", this issue is too technical for the public," Golubev told journalists. """"This issue is not even subject to discussion"," he said. It would be a mistake to compare average pipeline construction costs to Power of Siberia and other pipelines. """"After all", they are very different. Every kilometer is different. There are forests in one place, mountains in another, a lot of water barriers that must be crossed by various means, by directional drilling, he said. When another deputy CEO, Vitaly Markelov, was asked about the value of the Stroytransgaz contract," he said: """"You are asking the kind of question that cannot be answered. These are contracts."""" Representatives in Gazprom's department for managing corporate costs said that tenders on the pipeline construction were planned back in the fall last year", but so far not a single one has been held. A source familiar with the situation told Interfax that Gazprom has not conducted them because the project documentation on the pipeline sections is not fully ready. That means that more contractors for the gas pipeline construction will be designated rather than chosen in tenders. Meanwhile, according to comments from Markelov, just one contract has been awarded: to Stroytransgaz on construction of the 208-kilometer Chayanda-Lensk segment. Pipe purchases Gazprom in 2015 may double the purchase of pipes to 1.7 million-2 million tonnes, the chairman of the coordinating board of the Pipe Producers Association, Ivan Shabalov, said at the Metallurgical Summit in Moscow. He said that the need of Gazprom for large diameter pipe until 2020 may be 2 million tonnes a year. Just days after a conference of Russian pipe makers, hosted by the Volzhsky Pipe Works, Gazprom has called a new tender for repair and maintenance pipes, raising its price 33%. Gazprom Komplektatsiya, the Russian gas giant's procurement arm, has called a new tender for the procurement of R&M pipes for trunk pipelines worth 31.4 billion rubles (including VAT). The procurement of a total of 358,000 tonnes of large-diameter pipes is split into 17 lots averaging at 2 billion rubles each, with delivery in H2 2015 and H1 2016. Last year, when tenders were held in July and October, the price per tonne of pipes (1,420 mm diameter, 18.7 mm wall thickness, anti-corrosive, insulation, end caps, VAT) was 67,159 rubles. A tender at which Gazprom intended to offer 77,974 rubles per tonne was called in April this year but then canceled. The company is offering 89,"144 rubles a tonne at the latest tender. MOSCOW. June 1 (Interfax) - China has confirmed the possibility of accepting 15.6 million tonnes of oil in 2015 along the Skovorodino-Mohe branch pipeline from the East Siberia-Pacific Ocean (ESPO) pipeline system. """"At the talks that were held", China confirmed the possibility of accepting via Skovorodino-Mohe 15.6 million tonnes of oil in 2015 and looking for the opportunity for another 400,000 tonnes, the advisor to the president of Transneft and company press secretary, Igor Dyomin, told Interfax. So, oil supplies along the branch pipeline, if there is a positive decision by China, may amount to 16 million tonnes in 2015. In 2014, 15.6 million tonnes of oil were supplied via the Skovorodino-Mohe branch. Before this, China spoke about its readiness to accept only 15 million tonnes via the branch pipeline in 2015. Russia, under an agreement with CNPC, ships 15 million tonnes of crude to China annually along a branch from the Eastern Siberia - Pacific Ocean (ESPO) oil pipeline system. The pipeline branch runs 64 km within Russia and about 1,000 km through China. The relevant 20-year contracts were secured by Rosneft and Russian oil pipeline monopoly Transneft in 2009 and shipments began on January 1, 2011. In exchange for the long-term oil supplies, in 2009 Rosneft received a $15 billion loan from Chinese banks and Transneft received $10 billion. Later, Rosneft agreed with China to gradually increase oil shipments. The new agreement calls for ramping up shipments in line with infrastructure capabilities to a peak of up to 31 million tonnes along three routes. Under the agreement on additional supplies, an additional 800,000 tonnes of oil was supposed to be shipped along the Skovorodino-Mohe pipeline from July 1, 2013 to December 31, 2013; 2 million tonnes from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2014; 5 million tonnes annually from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2017; 15 million tonnes annually from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2037; and 7.5 million tonnes from January 1 to June 30, 2038. In order to increase oil shipments along the Skovorodino-Mohe pipeline to 15 million tonnes per year, Russia must ensure timely reconstruction and expansion of the branch and China must do the same for the Mohe-Dajing pipeline by January 1, 2018. The Skovorodino-Mohe pipeline was supposed to be overhauled by January 1, 2015 to increase oil shipments via the branch by 5 million tonnes. Meanwhile China informed Rosneft about the impossibility of completing work on the expansion of the branch pipeline on its territory due to a number of legislative acts, which made the requirements for pipeline transport for the environment and safety more difficult. In connection with this, Rosneft and China have signed a technical agreement allowing temporary changes to the delivery point for the long-term export contract for buying and selling oil from June 21, 2013. This gives Rosneft the ability to supply oil under the contract through the port of Kozmino, the terminus of the ESPO pipeline, as well as through the Skvorodino spur. The alternate route will remain in effect until the Chinese side completes upgrades to its pipeline segment. The Energy Ministry has received technical approval from Transneft to ship an additional 5 million tonnes through Kozmino, but Rosneft has not been able to reach agreement with other producers to cede capacity on the pipeline to Kozmino or purchase oil being delivered to the port. As a result, according to the ESPO oil supply schedule, Rosneft pumped 700,000 tonnes of crude to Kozmino in the first quarter and will pump 800,"000 tonnes in the second quarter. At present the capacity of Kozmino is 30 million tonnes a year. Last week Transneft President Nikolai Tokarev told Interfax that the company for now does not understand whether or not China is ready to accept 30 million tonnes of oil via the branch pipeline from the Skovorodino-Mohe branch pipeline starting in 2018. """"We are ready now at Mohe to already pump 20 million tonnes a year. We implemented all technical work and since January 1", we have been ready, but China cannot take [the oil], the company head said. MOSCOW. May 29 (Interfax) - The board of directors of Transneft has recommended dividends for 2014 in the amount of 318.67 rubles per common share and 757.87 rubles per preferred share, the Russian oil pipeline monopoly said in a statement. The total payout could be 2.9 billion rubles, of 25% of net profit, including 1.768 billion rubles for ordinary shares and 1.178 billion rubles for preferred shares. The dividend record date will be 20 days after dividends are approved by the annual shareholders meeting. The dividend paid on ordinary shares for 2013 was 1,221.38 rubles and that on preferred shares was 724.21 rubles per share," so the 2014 dividends will fall 73.1% for ordinary shares but grow 4.6% for preferred shares. Transneft President Nikolai Tokarev said meanwhile thatthe process of issuing new shares by Transneft could take a year. """"The Russian Federal Property Agency (Rosimuschestvo) is looking at this. After all it's not just a share issue but the interests of minority shareholders", the holders of preferred shares that are at stake. Rosimuschestvo is doing all the calculations and looking when the best time might be, at the volume. It'll take time. We expect we'll be taking about a year over this, not less, he said. Tokarev said that once Transneft becomes a fully-fledged shareholder of the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) as the result of the share issue, it can then expect to receive some of the funds that the CPC allocates to its shareholders to settle debt. Transneft has ordered a valuation of ordinary shares to determine the parameters of a share issue. Igor Dyomin, advisor to the head of Transneft, has told Interfax that the new shares would be issued in order to pay for state property that is under the company's management and hat will be contributed to its share capital. He did not say what property was at stake. KYIV. June 2 (Interfax) - Slovakia plans to preserve reverse gas supply volumes to Ukraine, Slovak Prime Minister Roberto Fico said. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko had a telephone conversation with Fico, and both agreed to coordinate their positions regarding the key issues of bilateral relations," including gas relations. The two discussed """"a wide range of issues on economic interaction", including the energy component and aspects of natural gas transit. The prime minister of Slovakia has confirmed the intention of his country to preserve the volume of reverse gas supply to Ukraine," reads a report posted on the president's website late on Monday. On May 20 Slovak President Andrej Kiska at a joint press conference with Poroshenko in Kyiv said that reserve gas supplies organized from his country is functioning and that Bratislava is ready to support Kyiv on the issue. """"Slovakia", as a country, started to supply gas in reverse to Ukraine and I spoke about this today with Mr. Poroshenko, who rated this very highly, because this was a lot of help for Ukraine. This reverse flow is completely ready…The reverse flow will be in effect and we are ready to support Ukraine in this entirely, Kiska said at the joint press conference in Kyiv. As for the energy security of Ukraine and the EU, these issues will be resolved jointly, Kiska said. Slovakia has drafted a project of its own, uniting Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia, due to the implementation of the South Stream project, Fico said at a meeting with his Russian counterpart Dmitry Medvedev on Tuesday. Fico also said that following an end to the transit of Russian gas to the EU via Ukraine and Slovakia after 2020," his country's budget would suffer substantial losses. Medvedev said some European countries were regretting that the South Stream pipeline project will not go ahead. """"As for Turkish Stream", you know the story. It arose because European partners torpedoed the South Stream project. Now of course, some countries are regretting this, Medvedev said. Russia is ready to study the issue of connecting the proposed Eastring gas pipeline system to Turkish Stream, Medvedev said. Fico said the Eastring project would acquire more importance in parallel with Turkish Stream. BAKU. June 2 (Interfax) - State Oil Company of the Azerbaijani Republic (SOCAR) has selected the consultant to resolve the issue of financing its stake in the Trans Anatolia Natural Gas Pipeline (TANAP) project," the head of SOCAR's investment department Vagif Aliyev told journalists on Tuesday. """"At present work is underway to raise additional financing for the TANAP project. We are at the stage of selecting the financial consultant. This is necessary in order to study all existing and potential sources of financing and then advance to the stage of agreeing with them on financing issues"," Aliyev said. Aliyev did not specify the volume of funds that would be raised to carry out the project. """"Azerbaijan's interests in the TANAP project are represented by the Canub Qaz Dehlizi [Southern Gas Corridor] closed joint stock company", in which the government of Azerbaijan and SOCAR are shareholders. Therefore, questions about how much will be raised on what terms, will be discussed in this format. Overall in international practice, raising funds to finance a project is a very complex and protracted process, he said. Aliyev said he hopes for problem-free implementation of the Trans Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) project," similar to TANAP. """"I hope that there are no problems at all with TAP. All of the parties must demonstrate accountability", since this is our common cause, Aliyev said in opening remarks at the International Caspian Oil and Gas Exhibition in Baku on Tuesday. The TAP project requires a considerable coordination effort from the participating countries," stemming from a high level of mutual trust. """"No one here should want supplementary preferences", he said, noting that all of the agreements and liabilities are written into the corresponding documents. Aliyev pointed out that at the same event one year ago," he said Azerbaijan would mark new successes in implementing the national energy strategy and that big changes concerning implementation of the Southern Gas Corridor project had occurred. """"The Southern Gas Corridor project is already a reality. It is already being implemented", Aliyev said. Despite entering its 22nd year, interest in the Baku exhibition remains high, he said. Energy cooperation with foreign partners is built on a solid foundation, as exemplified by relations between State Oil Company of the Azerbaijani Republic (SOCAR) and BP, who have been cooperating for over 20 years and will continue developing cooperation in the decades to come, he said. Elsewhere, Serbia, which was a potential participant in the South Stream gas pipeline project which has been called off," is ready to join TAP. """"Regarding energy safety", energy security, we are ready to diversify the sources of gas for Serbia, which is very important for our American friends as well," Serbian Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic told The Associated Press in an interview. """"In a major policy shift", the Serbian prime minister said his country will accept U.S. calls to reduce dependency on Russian gas by adding an American-backed pipeline that would bring gas to Europe from Azerbaijan, AP said. The United States has been encouraging Balkan and other states to move forward with the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline, which will take gas from Azerbaijan to Italy, rather than setting its hopes on another project that would pipe Russian gas through Turkey," it said. """"It's not about balancing", our strategic goal is EU path and we are very firm on our EU path," Vucic told AP. """"Yes", on the other hand, we would like to preserve good relationship with Russia, he said. *** Ukrtransgaz will spend UAH 400 million on preparations for the heating season which started in May. The company plans to overhaul 34 km of trunk gas pipelines, reconstruct and repair 269 gas distribution stations, inspect 544 underwater and 249 surface transition pipeline sections, and examine 335 km of pipelines. (28/5) *** The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) has uncovered abuse of office by officials of public joint-stock company Ukrtransnafta when they signed deals on storing pipeline crude oil. (29/5) *** Oil shipments at the sea terminal of the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) in January-May 2015 was 18.069 million tonnes of oil, which is 12.4% more than in the same period of 2014, CPC data said. (1/6) *** SOCAR exported 678,046 tonnes of oil from the Novorossiysk port in Russia via the Baku-Novorossiysk pipeline in the first five months of 2015, 60% more than in the same period of last year, the company said. This included 169,"559 tonnes in May. (2/6) MORE: Full coverage of all our round-up news can be found in the Interfax Energy Daily. ST. PETERSBURG. May 29 (Interfax) - Rosneft and Lukoil have applied to bid at a tender for the rights to the onshore part of the Vostochno-Taimyrsky hydrocarbons section in Krasnoyarsk territory. """"Two companies have submitted applications - Rosneft and Lukoil-West Siberia", Natural Resources Minister Sergei Donskoi told Interfax on the sidelines of the Nevsky International Ecological Congress in St. Petersburg. MOSCOW. June 1 (Interfax) - Russia's oil export duty will rise by $27.9 starting June 1,2015, to $144.4 per tonne, Interfax calculated, based on data from the Russian Finance Ministry. The export duty is currently $116.5 per tonnes. Finance Ministry expert Alexander Sakovich told Interfax that the average monitoring price between April 15 and May 14 was $62.59048 per barrel, or $456.9 per tonne. The Russian government is therefore likely to set the duty at $144.4 per tonne. The discounted duty on Eastern Siberian oil, oil from Caspian Sea deposits and the Prirazlomnoye deposit will again be zero starting on June 1 due to the formula approved in the tax maneuver for the oil industry. This took effect in February, before which the duty had been at $11.9 since January 1. With the new formula and oil prices falling below $65 per barrel, the size of the duty becomes negative and a zero duty should be set, according to legislation. The duty on highly viscous oil will rise to $18.5 from $14.7. The duty on light oil products will grow to $69.3 per tonne from $55.9 a tonne, and that on dark products to $109.7 from $88.5 per tonne. The export duty on saleable gasoline will be $112.6 per tonne, up from $90.8 at present, and that on straight-run gasoline - $122.7 a tonne, up from $99 per tonne. The duty on liquefied gas will remain at zero. The duty on coke will rise to $9.3 from $7.5. MINSK. May 29 (Interfax) - Belarus will increase the duties on oil and petroleum products exported outside the Customs Union to the same level as Russia's effective June 1, 2015. The crude oil export duty will rise to $144.4/tonne from $116.5/tonne, the Belarusian Council of Ministers said on the national legal information website. The duties on straight-run gasoline and commercial gasoline will increase to $122.7/tonne and $112.6/tonne from $99/tonne and $90.8/tonne respectively. The duty for light and medium distillates and diesel fuel will go up to $69.3/tonne from $55.9/tonne. The same rate will apply for benzene, toluene, xylenes, fuel oil, lubricating and other oils.

May 29 (Interfax) - Export of goods by Russia's fuel and energy sector fell 33.6% in Q1 2015 year-on-year to $58.9 billion, Rosstat reported. Russian crude oil exports fell to $22.7 billion in the quarter, 41.5% less than in the same period last year. The value of gas exports dropped 35% to $11.5 billion.

June 3 (Interfax) - Ukraine in January-May 2015 reduced transit of natural gas to Europe and Moldova by 23.5% compared to the same period in 2014, to 23.364 billion cubic meters (bcm). A total of 22.006 bcm was delivered to Europe in the five months and 1.358 bcm to Moldova, according to operational data from Ukrtransgaz. In May 2015, gas transit to Europe and Moldova fell 12.1% year-on-year to 5.395 bcm, including 5.229 bcm to Europe and 0.166 bcm. As reported, gas transit through Ukraine in 2014 fell 27.8% to 62.197 billion cubic meters and was down 31.4% in Q1 2015 year-on-year to 12.765 billion cubic meters. Ukrtransgaz, which is wholly owned by Naftogaz Ukrainy, operates Ukraine's trunk gas pipeline system and its 12 underground storage facilities. *** Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev called on Wednesday for clarifying the mechanism for implementing international court rulings in Russia in light of the risk of rulings being politicized. This may refer to the rulings of commercial arbitration courts. The justice minister, meanwhile, said Russia should be prepared for the worst in regard to the Hague court ruling ordering Russia to pay $50 billion to the former shareholders of Yukos oil company (Vedomosti, p. 2; Kommersant, p. 1). *** The chances of Gazprom's Turkish Stream gas pipeline going beyond Turkey are getting slimmer. One of the key countries for the onshore route, Macedonia insists the project must have European Union approval. It will also be almost impossible for the Russian gas giant to secure contracts to lay the third and fourth lines of the pipeline across the Black Sea, which would be needed to supply the pipeline in Europe (Kommersant, p. 1). *** Since the outlook for Rosneft's construction of a new oil refinery in Russia's Far East is unclear, officials are looking for ways to resolve the shortage of gasoline in the region, which has the highest fuel prices in the country. The Federal Anti-Monopoly Service is proposing swap deals with fuel, while the Energy Ministry is proposing to lower rail freight tariffs for fuel shipments to the Far East (Vedomosti, p. 11). *** Trafigura has become the biggest exporter of Russian oil, shipping about 18 million barrels in April-May. The Swiss trader achieved this thanks to contracts with state oil major Rosneft on prepayment terms. Trafigura has increased monthly purchases from Rosneft from 200,000 tonnes to 1.6 million tonnes in the past year. Advances allow Rosneft to raise short-term financing without increasing debt (Vedomosti, p. 10). *** Russia's Economic Development Ministry is proposing to force Gazprom to disclose the structure of its capital expenditures in order to increase the transparency of how rates are calculated, as well as obligate the state gas giant to build pipelines for the needs of independent gas producers, who have long asked for such measures. But the ministry does not yet have specific proposals for how to do this and previous initiatives were never implemented (Kommersant, p. 9). *** With Russia's potential European allies on Turkish Stream having doubts about the prospects of the gas pipeline project, Gazprom is putting the powerful financial element on the negotiation table. The gas giant, which had refused to participate in construction of the onshore section of the pipeline, has changed its mind and offered its participation at least to Greece. This is the arrangement under which the project's predecessor, South Stream was supposed to be built (Kommersant, p. 7). *** Gazprom Neft said that all of the ESPO oil it has shipped to China in 2015 has been sold for yuan. The Russian oil company began working on switching contracts to other currencies than the dollar last summer. But analysts believe there are virtually no economic benefits in this and that the company is just doing the bidding of the authorities (Vedomosti, p. 11). *** Interview: Mikhail Sutyaginsky, Co-owner and Chairman of Titan Group (Vedomosti, p. 8). *** Rosatom, which aims to expand its order portfolio by 50% to $150 billion by 2020, has for the first time announced the possibility of raising foreign financing. Chinese banks and energy companies are being considered as possible investors. Until now, one of the state nuclear corporation's advantages on the world market for nuclear power plants has been the financial support of the state, but now state funding is dwindling while Rosatom is continuing to fight for new markets (Kommersant, p. 7). *** Slovakia, which could be left without transit gas after Russia stops shipping gas through Ukraine in 2019, has proposed to Gazprom to make its Eastring transport system with Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania a part of the Turkish Stream pipeline. In this case Slovakia would be able to retain at least part of the transit through its territory. Moscow has promised to consider this option, and analysts said it is quite doable (Kommersant, p. 7; Vedomosti, p. 12). *** Russia's Finance Ministry is refusing to endorse a draft report on National Welfare Fund financing for Rosneft projects submitted by the Economic Development Ministry, which has proposed approving five of the 28 projects for which the state oil major is seeking NWF funding. The Finance Ministry does not want to use NWF money to finance projects in the oil sector, officials said (Vedomosti, p. 10).

"AZERBAIJAN Azeri president urges intl community to step up Karabakh settlement Azeri President Ilham Aliyev urged the international community and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to work more actively to settle the Armenian-Azeri conflict peacefully. ""I hope that the international community and the OSCE will work more actively on this issue in order to restore international law and historical justice, and to allow Azerbaijan to start restoration work after the liberation of the occupied territory,"" Aliyev said on Monday after talks with the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe's Chairman-in-Office, Swiss President Didier Burkhalter. Aliyev said that Nagorno Karabakh is Azerbaijan's historical integral part. He also said that the UN Security Council passed four resolutions demanding Armenian troops' immediate and unconditional withdrawal from the occupied Azeri territory. ""Despite repeated statements made by the presidents of the states co-chairing the OSCE Minsk Group that the status quo is unacceptable, Armenia wants to perpetuate it. If the status quo is to be changed Armenia must start pulling out its troops,"" Aliyev said. Necessity has arisen to hold one more meeting between the presidents of Azerbaijan and Armenia within the framework of the talks on the peaceful settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, the Organization for Security and Cooperatiion in Europe's Chairman-in-Office, Swiss President Didier Burkhalter said. Burkhalter said, while making a joint statement with Azeri President Ilham Aliyev following bilateral talks on Monday, that the goal of his arrival in Baku was to hear different views and, possibly, to find ways of ensuring progress in the negotiating process. He also said that his attitude to the settlement of the Armenian-Azeri conflict as the OSCE's chairman-in-office, is obvious. Consistent steps should be made towards peace, he said. This means, he continued, that two main things should be done. First, dialogue should be intensified, he said. Dialogue was underway already, but necessity has arisen to hold a new meeting between the Azeri and Armenian presidents, Burkhalter said. A proposal is on the agenda to organize such a meeting in Paris, he said. The OSCE supports this idea and wants the meeting to be held in the near future, Burkhalter said, adding that the meeting must become the starting point for a new phase in the talks. On the other hand, it could be a structured negotiating process leading to a peace agreement, he said. This negotiating process must proceed on the basis of the model principles, Burkhalter said. The second thing to be done is to strengthen the ceasefire regime, he said. The mechanism of investigating incidents, approved by all the parties in the past, but never implemented, remains the most important issue, he said. Burkhalter said that Switzerland is ready to assist the peaceful negotiating process for the sake of settling the Armenian-Azeri conflict. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has reaffirmed his country's commitment to inter-religious peace. ""We will always be reliable neighbors, partners and friends to all people, whatever their religion and whatever church they choose,"" Lukashenko told the attendees of the European Christian Orthodox-Catholic Forum titled, ""Religion and cultural diversity: challenges to Christian churches in Europe,"" in Minsk on Tuesday. ""I want to reassure you that in this respect you will never have any grievances against the Belarusian people and state,"" the president stressed. He also said that his meeting with the forum attendees ""obliges me and the whole of Belarusian people to approach the question of preserving inter-religious peace and national accord with even greater diligence and responsibility."" ""Belarus is unique in that its history is not darkened by religious wars and inter-ethnic conflicts,"" Lukashenko said. ""We caringly preserve and pass from generation to generation the good traditions of our ancestors: mutual understanding, tolerance, compassion, respect for labor, peacefulness and patriotism,"" he said. ""The Orthodox Christianity and Catholicism have historically shaped the mentality and national character of the Belarusians. And today the Christian faith remains an integral part of the worldview and spiritual life for a majority of our citizens,"" Lukashenko said. He said in his view, the European Christian Orthodox-Catholic Forum ""must foster stronger cooperation between people of various faiths and views and help them find common ground through discussion and fruitful dialogue."" ""One must not forget that the present-day world sees an ever increasing number of hotbeds of tensions and war conflict zones which bring enormous suffering to people,"" the president said. This is why all nations must work together to ensure a peaceful future for humankind, Lukashenko said. ""But such work is only possible with active and concerted efforts of both the authorities and public institutions, and first and foremost religious organizations,"" he said.

""We are watching closely the events in Abkhazia as it is occupied territory where our citizens reside, whose interests we are not able to defend,"" Margvelashvili said at a news conference joint with Swiss President Didier Burkhalter on Tuesday.

""At the end of the meeting, the sides agreed to further bolster ties between the law enforcement agencies of the two countries,"" it said. Bishkek's plans to sign an extradition agreement with London can mainly be explained by the Kyrgyz authorities' plans to secure the return of former President Kurmanbek Bakiyev's son, Maxim, who has been accused by Bishkek of corruption, misappropriation, corporate raiding and other crimes. Maxim Bakiyev currently resides in the United Kingdom, where he has been given political refugee status.

Human Rights Commissioner Ella Pamfilova briefed Putin on problems that refugees and Crimean residents are experiencing at a meeting on Tuesday. ""I will instruct the presidential secretariat to help implement all of your proposals along with the government,"" Putin said. Pamfilova said the number of refugees from southeastern regions of Ukraine has begun to grow, but not all Russian regions are providing assistance to them. ""According to my information, the inflow of people from the east [of Ukraine] has begun to grow, and not only to the border districts [of Russia], but some of them have even reached Yekaterinburg. In some places, the authorities are reacting promptly, but in others absolutely indifferently. People are helping, but there's no system. It seems to me that we need an urgent systemic program as to how these people should be received, provided with jobs, and so on,"" she said. Pamfilova said also with reference to experts whom she said she trusted that about 50,000 people in Crimea and Sevastopol want to acquire Russian citizenship but cannot do so as they did not have permanent residential registration in that territory. ***Russian Human Rights Commissioner Ella Pamfilova is astounded by the Western countries' reaction to the humanitarian situation in the southeastern part of Ukraine and calls for setting up a humanitarian corridor for refugees there. ""A humanitarian corridor is needed there [in the combat area]. I am simply astounded by seeing how a lot of our authoritative international organizations, the entire illuminated Western world, have suddenly become simultaneously deaf, mute, and blind and don't see that there is a truly horrible tragedy there with children and people wanting to flee areas fired upon,"" Pamfilova said at a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday. Russian President Vladimir Putin and German Chancellor Angela Merkel have talked on the telephone, the Kremlin press office said in a statement on Tuesday.

In the framework of celebrations marking the 70th anniversary of the Allied troops landing in Normandy, Putin ""will have many contacts, as they say, on foot,"" Peskov said. Peskov announced that the Russian president and British prime minister would discuss Ukraine in a comprehensive way. ""We will make a point that the continuing punitive operation in southeastern Ukraine is unacceptable,"" he said in an interview with the Russian News Service.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has held a meeting with former French leader Nicolas Sarkozy in Russia's Black Sea resort of Sochi, Putin's press secretary Dmitry Peskov told Interfax. ""I confirm this. Indeed, such a meeting took place in Sochi. It was a private one,"" Peskov said. The meeting was first reported by French media. While discussing the gas issue with Ukraine, Russian negotiators show flexibility but it is evident that the issue of debt for which was gas supplied be resolved, Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. ""In any case first the debt issue should be resolved,"" Peskov said. At the same time, ""one thing is evident - in this case Russian negotiators show flexibility and interest in searching for a solution,"" he said. ""As it is known, for now the sum, which came in the settlement of the debt, is far from covering the entire debt,"" Peskov said. When asked whether the discussion of gas topics could be brought to a different level, the spokesman said that ""everything should be done stage-by-stage"" but first the debt issue should be resolved. ""A lot will depend on Ukraine,"" Peskov said.

Tajikistan has the longest border with Afghanistan, 1,344 kilometers, amongst CIS countries. Tajik law enforcers annually impound tonnes of Afghan drugs in transit to Russia, Eastern and Western Europe. Some experts fear security levels in Afghanistan may reduce with the pullout of NATO forces and attempts of incursions from Afghanistan into CIS countries may grow frequent. The United States pledges to help Tajikistan's border reinforcement. The Tajik presidential press service said the sides also discussed bilateral relations and cooperation in politics, regional, security, economy, trade, investment, science and technology.

Ukraine insists on keeping the price of $268.5 per 1,000 cubic meters of Russian natural gas, but it is prepared to agree to a certain increase of this price as part of a possible compromise to be reached with Russia, Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatseniuk has said. ""It [the gas price] may deviate somewhat from the price of $268.5,"" he said in parliament on Tuesday. Yatseniuk, however, declined to say exactly how the new figure could differ from today's price, saying that his remarks may influence the ongoing trilateral talks. Ukraine needs to purchase 7 billion cubic meters more gas to ensure the next heating season, Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatseniuk said in Verkhovna Rada on Tuesday. ""When we [the new government] came, underground storage facilities had 5 billion cubic meters gas - this is virtually buffer gas, which is impossible to lift. Underground storage facilities currently have 12 billion cubic meters gas. It is necessary to buy at least 7 billion cubic meters more to get through the heating season,"" Yatseniuk said. It has been reported that in 2013 Ukraine pumped 11.635 billion cubic meters of gas into underground storage facilities. In 2013 withdraws of natural gas exceeded pumping 8.9% (1.03 billion cubic meters) and amounted to 12.665 billion cubic meters, in particular 12.328 billion cubic meters were withdrawn from Ukrtransgaz underground storage facilities and 0.337 billion cubic meters from Chornomornaftogaz or Black Sea Gas. Ukraine has 13 underground gas storage facilities with a total capacity of around 32 billion cubic meters. Ukrtransgaz operates 12 storage facilities (31 billion cubic meters) and Chornomornaftogaz the other one (1 billion cubic meters). Since Crimea's accession to Russia, Naftogaz Ukrainy does not receive information from Chornomornaftogaz on storage, extraction, transportation and use of natural gas, oil and condensate from March 14, 2014. The Ukrainian government intends to file a lawsuit exceeding one trillion hryvnia for damage sustained as a result of Crimea's accession to Russia, Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatseniuk said. ""As to the lawsuits: Ukraine has started this process, I would like to inform you that the Prosecutor General's Office has started the investigation and in the framework of the criminal case the Ukrainian government files a lawsuit exceeding one trillion hryvnia,"" Yatseniuk said in Verkhovna Rada on Tuesday when asked about lawsuits over Russia's actions in Crimea and damage inflicted to Ukraine. Ukraine will create public joint-stock companies Ukrainian GTS and Ukrainian Gas Storage Facilities on the basis of Ukrtransgaz, Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatseniuk said in the parliament on Tuesday. ""The Ukrainian government will create public joint-stock company Ukrainian gas transport system, which will only transport gas under EC directives and according to our liabilities from Ukraine's membership in the Energy Community,"" he said. ""We're also creating public joint-stock company Ukrainian Gas Storage Facilities. This will be only the operator that will work with all entities in the area of storing and selling natural gas,"" he added. Yatseniuk said that Ukraine, as a member of the European Energy Charter and Energy Community, proposed that the point of accepting Russian natural gas is transferred to the Ukrainian-Russian border and the new agreements are signed. ""As a part of this work we addressed Europe in public, as it is time to change the point of accepting Russian natural gas. Let me noted that now due to unclear reasons Russian gas is accepted by the European Union not on the Ukrainian-Russian border but on the EU-Ukraine border,"" he said. The premier said that Gazprom is involved in blackmailing by assigning different prices for natural gas for various EU companies. ""We believe that jointly with Europe we should change the EU energy map, and this is not only in the interests of Ukraine. Gazprom is blackmailing Europe the same way. Gazprom and Russia are trying to offer a better contract to one companies and the worse contract to other companies,"" he added. Ukrtransgaz, whose 100% stake is held by Naftogaz Ukrainy, operates a system of trunk gas pipelines and 12 underground gas depots. The Ukrainian gas pipeline system's handling capacity is 288 billion cubic meters at the entrance and 178.5 billion cubic meters at the exit, including 142.5 billion cubic meters channeled to Europe and 3.5 billion cubic meters to Moldova. The building of coal-fuelled synthetic natural gas (SNG) and national gas liquid (NGL) plants in Ukraine planned by the previous government using Chinese funds secured by the state is inappropriate, Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatseniuk has said. ""The so-called coal gasification project has neither an economic basis nor technological basis,"" he said speaking in the parliament on Tuesday. As reported, Naftogaz Ukrainy in December 2012 signed a loan agreement with the China Development Bank Corporation on the attraction of government secured $3.656 billion to realize projects on the replacement of consumption of natural gas with coal. The credit line is opened for 19 years (2012-2031). Its value is $2.396 billion. Four years is given to prepare and agree the approved projects and the signing of individual credit agreements for a period of 15 years. The SNG plants will be built in Luhansk, Donetsk and Odesa regions using the oil company Shell's technologies, which have been tested in China. The implementation of the project for the construction of SNG plants will allow Ukraine to save up to 4 billion cubic meters of natural gas, sell 10 million tonnes of coal per year, and create more than 2,000 jobs. The terms of the start of the realization of the project has been postponed several times. The terms were again announced early 2014 when former Energy and Coal Industry Minister Eduard Stavytsky said that Ukraine would start building coal gasification plants in cooperation with China in September 2014.

Moldovan Prime Minister Valeriu Strelet, who intends to meet with protesters on Thursday, has given an account of his work and made public the government's plans for the future. ""The government was set up on July 30, and so we've been working for 42 days. I don't see reasons for its resignation as the government is working efficiently. We have resolved a lot of problems inherited [from the previous administration] in this time. We have held six sessions, considered over 130 issues and held four sessions of the Financial Stability Committee. This is all aimed at improving the people's lives,"" Strelet said at a press conference on Thursday. ""The government's actions create a platform and preconditions for resolving the problems that society is facing,"" he said. ""I don't see reasons for the government, which has just started working, to resign. We know for sure that most of the people want the government to work rather than resign. We will continue to work. I believe that our report on the first hundred days of the government's work will be much fuller and more informative,"" he said. He confirmed that a meeting with representatives of the so-called Grand National Assembly council set up by the participants of the protest on the central square of Chisinau was scheduled for Thursday morning. ""We will discuss their demands together and try to find solutions to problems in a way that meets the people's interests together,"" he said. Russian President Vladimir Putin, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Francois Hollande and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko will have agreed to meet in Paris on October 2 in a telephone conversation on Wednesday night, the Russian presidential press service reported. ""It was agreed to continue active work in the 'Normandy format', which includes the holding of negotiations at the level of foreign ministers in Berlin on September 12, as well as a personal meeting of the leaders of Russia, Germany, France and Ukraine in Paris on October 2,"" the press service said in a statement. The parties also discussed the settlement of the crisis in southeastern Ukraine given the results of meetings of the Trilateral Contact Group for Ukraine and its working groups in Minsk on September 8, it said. Russian President Vladimir Putin has stated the need for the finetuning of a full-fledged dialog between representatives of Kyiv and southeastern Ukraine in a telephone conversation with the 'Normandy four' leaders on Wednesday night, the Kremlin press service reported. ""Particular attention given to the implementation of the political provisions of the Minsk agreements, primarily the holding of the constitutional reform in Ukraine, including the formalization of the special status for Donbas regions, as well as the organization of local elections and the adoption of the amnesty law. In this regard, Putin has again stressed the need for the fastest possible fine-tuning of a full-fledged direct dialog between Kyiv authorities and representatives of southeastern Ukraine,"" the press service said in a statement. The parties agreed to continue active work in the ""Normandy format' which include a meeting of foreign ministers in Berlin on September 12, as well as a personal meeting of the leaders of Russia, Germany, France and Ukraine in Paris on October 2. The leaders of 'Normandy format' countries, Russia, France, Germany and Ukraine, have welcomed the ceasefire in southeastern Ukraine, the Kremlin press service said. ""The leaders welcomed the ceasefire that recently has been established in southeastern Ukraine. The withdrawal of mortar under 120 mm and artillery under 100 mm would meet the tasks of the further de-escalation of the situation and the creation of perquisites for the economic restoration of Donbas regions,"" a statement issued by the Kremlin press service on Wednesday night reads. Meanwhile, according to the Ukrainian presidential press service, the arms withdrawal process should be monitored by SMM OSCE inspectors, ""in particular, through the creation of permanently active points along the contact line."" Russia is willing to share its unique experience in conducting rescue and humanitarian operations in the world, and it expects to analyze the similar experience of its foreign partners, Russian President Vladimir Putin said. ""Manmade and natural disasters have been increasingly trans-frontier in their nature, and therefore it is extremely important to promote regional and global interaction in every possible way to prevent emergency situations and overcome their aftermath,"" Putin said in a greeting message to the participants in and guests of an international forum of firefighters and rescuers, published on the Kremlin website. Russia has always sought to consolidate the efforts of countries and organizations in this field, Putin said. ""We have a very rich experience in conducting rescue and humanitarian operations across the world. We are willing to share our unique achievements and provide assistance in personnel training. In turn, we expect to have the opportunity to thoroughly analyze the methods applied by our foreign partners,"" he said. Putin said he was sure that the forum would make a significant contribution to resolving relevant problems related to efforts against modern challenges and threats, and it would strengthen partnerships. Russian President Vladimir Putin will highlight the Syria problem and the fight against ISIL, the same as a majority of other speakers at the UN General Assembly session, Kremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Thursday. ""Apparently, most speeches delivered from the General Assembly rostrum will give much attention to Syrian affairs and the ISIL problem. One can presume with a high degree of probability that President Putin will also dwell on this problem,"" Peskov said. Russian President Vladimir Putin's meeting with U.S. President Barack Obama on the sidelines of the upcoming UN General Assembly has not been planned so far, Kremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov said. ""No such meeting is on the schedule so far,"" Peskov told journalists on Thursday. ""Certainly, he sees how the schedules coincide and when some initiative arises, then there'll be a more concrete analysis,"" he said. Asked whether the White House has made proposals on a meeting between the two leaders, Peskov said, ""No, there have been no such proposals so far."" Putin's meeting with the Pope is not officially planned during the UN General Assembly session, but the bilateral agenda is being coordinated now, Peskov said. ""This particular meeting is not on the schedule so far,"" he said. Different options for Putin's meetings are being explored now, which includes both ""separate bilateral meetings and the use of various protocol and other events within the General Assembly framework for the president to be able to talk with the heads of other states on the General Assembly's sidelines,"" Peskov said. Costs of taking in and accommodating refugees from the Middle East should be covered by the countries related to the destabilization in the refugees' home states, the Kremlin said. ""We expected most expenditures to be covered by the countries related to what had led to such a catastrophic situation in certain Maghreb countries in the Middle East,"" Kremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Thursday. Speaking about Russia's part in the refugee assistance program, the Kremlin representative said: ""The issue is hardly topical for the Russian Federation."" Peskov did not say which countries he was implying. ""I'd rather not go into details,"" he said. Russia is recording refugees' attempts to use its territory, including for moving to other countries, and the principal problem is that Islamic State fighters might be getting to Europe together with true refugees, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. ""It's true that attempts to use Russian territory have been recorded. In addition, as it's been said on numerous occasions, the greater danger is that, unfortunately, people from the so-called Islamic State, who have to do with combat actions, terrorist attacks, and killings, have been detected among the refugees in Europe, which the European authorities have confirmed,"" Peskov told journalists. ""This is a huge danger,"" he said. Russia's territory has been used both for settling in the country and for moving further to other states, he said. The issue of quotas on refugees is not on Russia's agenda: it is necessary to deal with the causes of this situation rather than its consequences, the Kremlin has said. ""It is impossible to resolve this problem on the external perimeter. One should not fight the consequences but rather address the cause that triggers the exodus of these people from their homeland,"" Kremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Thursday. In his words, quotas on refugees are not topical for Russia. ""This is not on the table, this is not a topical matter,"" Peskov said. The press secretary said he knew nothing about the European partners' request to the Russian president to ponder this issue. ""I know nothing about that, no. This is not an item on our agenda,"" Peskov said. Russia is providing assistance to the Syrian authorities in combating the Islamic State as they are the only force opposing this movement, says Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. ""Russia has stressed repeatedly that the threat emanating from the ISIL and from the ongoing expansion of the territory it influences and the territory it controls is absolutely obvious. The Syrian authorities are the only force that can offer resistance to this movement,"" Peskov said. ""There are simply no other organized and efficient forces there,"" Peskov said. Therefore, naturally, ""Russia sees it as its mission to provide assistance to Syrian authorities in combating this dangerous phenomenon,"" he said. ""This is exactly what's happening. This is what both the president and the foreign minister said. This is what explains the Russian Federation's attempts to provide the necessary assistance,"" Peskov said. Russian military specialists are helping Syrian counterparts to handle equipment, they do not participate in military actions, Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. ""Russia considers its task to give support to the Syrian authorities in the struggle against dangerous phenomenon such as the so-called Islamic State,"" Peskov told reporters on Thursday. ""This is exactly what explains Russia's attempts to provide necessary relevant aid,"" he said. As for the information about the alleged participation of Russian Armed Forces in combat actions in Syria, the spokesman said: ""The threat coming from ISIL and constant attempts to expand the area of influence which ISIL is controlling is absolutely obvious. And the only force which is resisting this advancement is the Syrian armed forces. There are just no other well-organized and viable forces."" Peskov recalled Russian President Vladimir Putin's previous statements on this issue. ""Nothing has changed for this period of time. There is no point in repeating anything,"" he said. Asked earlier in Vladivostok about the possible participation of Russian servicemen in the events in Syria, the Russian president said that different variants were considered but it is premature to talk about this. In reply to a question about confirming or rejecting the reports of some media outlets on the direct participation of Russian servicemen in the armed conflict in Syria, the presidential spokesman said that the Russian Foreign Ministry has already commented on this issue: ""All was explained. There are military specialists there who are engaged in the maintenance of special property, which is delivered to Syria absolutely according to international law,"" Peskov said. Russia is interested in retaining its positions on the global weapons market, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said. ""Our revenues from exports [of weapons and military hardware] are significant, and this is a very considerable factor in forming our budget. The existing contract portfolio amounts to $40 billion, and we are certainly interested in increasing its volume,"" Medvedev said at the official unveiling ceremony of Russia Arms Expo 2015, the 10th international exhibition of arms, military equipment and ammunition. Medvedev pointed out that some specimens displayed at the exhibition have no analogues and were manufactured based on Russian know-how. The 2015 exhibition has seen a record number of visitors, among them delegations from more than 60 countries and representatives of more than 160 Russian and foreign companies, including from Turkey, South Korea, France, Jordan, and others, he said. ""We cannot but be delighted by such a representative competition of foreign companies, which is an indicator of interest displayed in our exhibition and our weaponry specimens,"" Medvedev said. The course towards substitution of imported technologies in the defense sector is not a one-time affair, it is long-term, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has said. ""It will not be altered in our plans to fulfill the state armament program and to develop our military-technological cooperation,"" Medvedev said at the opening ceremony of the tenth international arms show, Russia Arms Expo 2015. Modernization and technological re-arming of defense plants are included in the Russian government's priorities in the period until 2018, he said. ""This work is in full swing, and it will be continued despite the not so easy budget situation,"" Medvedev said. President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko has instructed Cabinet of Ministers, Central Election Commission (CEC) and local self-government authorities to ensure a proper organization and holding of the local elections on October 25, 2015. The respective decree No. N538/2015 as of September 9, 2015, which was signed by the president at a meeting of the Regional Development Council, was posted on president's official website. President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko has thanked Italy for ratifying the Ukraine-EU Association Agreement with the European Union. ""I'm grateful to Italy for the ratification of Ukraine-EU Association Agreement,"" Poroshenko wrote on Twitter page. As reported on Wednesday, the Upper House of the Parliament of Italy (Senate) ratified the Association Agreement between Ukraine and European Union. Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatseniuk has proposed setting up a new platform in the European Union to support reforms in Ukraine, which would include countries that recently became EU members after implementing reforms. ""It would be a very good idea if the EU formed a new and strong mechanism to support reforms in Ukraine. This would be an association of all countries that have carried out reforms and become EU members over the past 20 years,"" Yatseniuk said at a joint press conference with Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico in Kyiv on Thursday. Such countries as Slovakia and Poland understand Ukraine's problems better than anyone else, Yatseniuk said. ""Surely, this platform should include Slovakia and Poland, and we talked about this with the premier. And everyone could be practically involved, like Slovakia, in helping Ukraine,"" he said. Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatseniuk said he is hoping that the European Union will not take into account issues relating to the new wave of migration to Europe when deciding on the issue of granting a visa-free regime to Ukraine. ""The liberalization of the visa regime for Ukrainians, to be more precise a visa-free regime for Ukrainians, is another real result of European integration that can be achieved. We are now going through technical missions with the EU and I hope that the decision on granting a visa-free regime to Ukraine will not have political aspects, including those related to the wave of migration to the EU,"" he said at a press conference he gave jointly with Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fiko in Bratislava on Thursday. Yatseniuk emphasized that Ukraine understands the program of migration that has arisen in Europe very well. ""Because the problem of migration is now estimated at thousands of people in Europe. It is due to conflict zones, to instability. The war is the reason why there are now 1.5 million temporarily displaced people in Ukraine,"" he said. The prime minister said this issue leads to huge budget losses associated with the cost of helping these people and their adaptation. ""We should look for answers to these questions together,"" Yatseniuk said. Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatseniuk has said that the Nord Stream II gas pipeline project goes against the European gas market's declared principles, would cause significant damage to Ukraine and Slovakia, and would perpetuate the European Union's energy dependence on Russia, and therefore Kyiv expects the European Commission to block this project. ""I hope that not only will the European Commission take note of this, but that the right decision will also be made, which would meet not the price but European values,"" Yatseniuk said at a joint press conference with Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico in Bratislava on Thursday. It was reported earlier that the shareholders in the company that would build the third and fourth lines of the Nord Stream gas pipeline had signed an agreement in Moscow on September 4. The new consortium includes six participants, i.e. Gazprom, E.ON, BASF/Wintershall, OMV, Engie, and Shell. Gazprom said in a statement that the joint project company New European Pipeline AG would deliver the project. Gazprom will own 51% of the company, E.ON, Shell, OMV and BASF/Wintershall will have 10% each and Engie 9%. Nord Stream II will add two lines, whose combined capacity should reach 55 billion cubic meters, to the existing pipeline that transports gas along the Baltic Sea floor from Russia to the German coast. The construction of the second phase of the Nord Stream gas pipeline would deprive Ukraine of the opportunity to pump 140 billion cubic meters of Russian natural gas to the European Union and to make $2 billion on this annually, Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatseniuk said at a joint press conference with Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico in Bratislava on Thursday. ""What does the Nord Stream II construction mean for Ukraine? First, it absolutely excludes Ukraine from transit supplies to the European Union. Second, it's the loss of $2 billion in revenues that we get for the transit and safe shipment of gas to the European Union. And third, it's simply unjust both to our European partners and to Ukraine,"" he said. The Nord Stream II construction would monopolize the routes of gas transportation to the European Union and would increase the price for the end users, he said. If Nord Stream II is built, the European Union will lose the opportunity to receive Russian gas directly along the shortest route across Ukraine, Yatseniuk said. This project would also deprive Slovakia of $800-million revenues from gas transportation, he said. After the first phase of the Nord Stream gas pipeline was built, Ukraine has lost $1.5 billion in revenues from gas transportation, Yatseniuk said. ""And this hasn't brought about any energy independence for the European Union: What's the difference where you get gas as long as you have the same supplier?"" he said. It was reported earlier that the Nord Stream II consortium comprises six participants, i.e. Gazprom, E.ON, BASF/Wintershall, OMV, Engie, and Shell. Nord Stream II will add two lines, whose combined capacity should reach 55 billion cubic meters, to the existing pipeline that transports gas along the Baltic Sea floor from Russia to Germany. Ukraine has increased the utilization of the Vojany-Uzhgorod gas pipeline, through which it receives gas from Slovakia, to 100%, Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatseniuk said at a news briefing with Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico in Bratislava on Thursday. ""Over the past several weeks, we have significantly increased the volume of gas purchases and have virtually reached the 100% capacity [of the Vojany-Uzhgorod gas pipeline utilization],"" Yatseniuk said. ""The volume of gas purchases depends on several factors. The first factor is internal consumption (naturally, it is significantly lower in a summer period). The second is the price for gas. The difference in prices between that at the beginning of the year and the current moment is already $30 per 1,000 cubic meters. Taking into account these two factors, we have decided now to increase the volume of the reverse flow from Slovakia to the maximum and use it 100%,"" he said. It was reported earlier that Ukraine has the opportunity to import gas from the EU through the Vojany-Uzhgorod pipeline, daily capacity of which is 40 billion to 41 billion cubic meters of gas. In May-July 2015, Ukraine utilized only 45% to 60% of this pipeline's capacity. Ukraine wants to become a part of the new European gas hub being created by Poland, Romania, Hungary and Slovakia, Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatseniuk said after a meeting with Poland's Prime Minister Ewa Kopacz on Wednesday in Warsaw. ""Ukraine wants to become a part of the large gas energy hub being created by Poland, Romania, Hungary and Slovakia. This means that gas flows between our countries would be free, and we will be ble to freely trade, without any restrictions,"" the press service of the government reported, citing Yatseniuk. He also said that Ukraine and Poland have signed a memorandum on construction of a gas interconnection pipeline between the two countries. He said that construction of the Ukrainian section of the gas pipeline would cost around $160 million. ""We're waiting for calculations from Polish friends,"" he said.

"Back before the 27 May incident on the Russian-Ukrainian border, your Novyye Izvestiya correspondent talked with Igor Strelkov, commander of the volunteer militia in Slovyansk. [Barkov] What forces does the volunteer militia in Slovyansk have? [Strelkov] We have a small quantity of weapons. Until recently we had small stocks of ammunition for prolonged fighting. The fighting with the enemy forces is in the proportion of 10 to one, with 10 National Guard combatants to one self-defense volunteer militiaman. In terms of weapons the proportion is 30-50 to one. We have a few trophy armored vehicles and a cannon. [Barkov] Where do you weapons come from? [Strelkov] We are arming ourselves using local resources. For instance, there are mines and mortars, but no fuses for them. A mine will not detonate without a fuse. Local inhabitants are bringing us everything -- from food to everyday items. They all want to help us. We are fed on the basis of donations from the local population. But if the enemy carries out his plan -- a total blockade of the city of Slovyansk -- the food situation will be bad too. [Barkov] What about people? [Strelkov] The entire volunteer militia in Slovyansk consists of volunteers who almost without exception are young men who have not served in the army. There are some who have served a year. We have an acute shortage of specialist officers. We lack company and platoon commanders, and experienced machine-gunners and grenade launcher operators. We have no administrative workers. But the volunteer militia are prepared to fight, and they are fighting. The enemy does not have the morale for fighting. So we are beating him. [Barkov] Where do your volunteers come from? [Strelkov] The volunteers who come to us are mainly from the local population, from neighboring cities and settlements. There are very few new volunteers from Russia. Almost none. People do not want to die. And people are being killed here. For instance, 50 men came to us. They were at Krasnyy Lyman -- which is very close to Slovyansk. They were there for two days. They saw things were hard here and there was real fighting, and they left for Antratsyt, 50 kilometers from Slovyansk, and set up there. A small unit of about 10 men arrived from Rostov Oblast. Those men are fighting. All members of public movements and parties, if they want to join us and help us, are taken on here, on the post, after undergoing testing, on the same basis for all. There are no separate formations if they join us and no party structures. We have the principle of one-man command., We have Crimean Cossacks., They are fighting. Armenians arrived, three of them, they stayed a few days, and they left. There is no one from Abkhazia and Chechnya. Those are all rumors. In general there is no big influx of volunteers. They say it is hard to reach us in Slovyansk. They are all lying! [Barkov] In your view, what should Russia do in the situation that has taken shape? [Strelkov] We will stand to the death in Slovyansk. But Russian troops should be brought in. Moscow does not understand the full gravity of the military situation. It is essential to make the political decision to bring Russian military forces into Ukraine. The Ukrainian military are afraid of Russia. I repeat once more: The political decision to bring in Russian troops is needed!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"BAKU. Feb 25 (Interfax) - The conflict in Ukraine broke out as a result of problems accumulating in Russia's relations with the West, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said during his visit to Azerbaijan. ""Ukraine is now paying the price of the problems existing between the West and Russia the same as Georgia did in the past,"" he said in a speech at the Azerbaijani Diplomatic Academy in Baku. The minister said that relaxation is needed in the present situation otherwise new conflicts are possible in the region. ""The breath of cold war is apparent today even though the Berlin wall fell a long time ago… Barriers remain in people's minds. If people continue sticking to such an approach, conflicts will not be limited only to Ukraine and Georgia,"" the minister stressed. He noted that despite two agreements in Minsk people continue dying in Ukraine. ""In Ukraine 35,000 foreign mercenaries are fighting. This is a great problem. What is going to happen when they return to their countries? Since last April the death toll in Ukraine has reached scores of thousands. The number of refugees has reached 1.2 million people. Radicalism is growing. How can we resist that?"" the Turkish official asked. He also spoke of the need to settle so-called frozen conflicts. ""The world must settle the frozen conflicts in Nagorno Karabakh, Transdniestria etc,"" the minister said adding that in the past few years hotspots also appeared in countries of the Arab Spring. In his opinion, in Nagorno Karabakh Armenia ""won nothing at all."" ""The documents adopted by the international community confirm that Nagorno Karabakh belongs to Azerbaijan. Armenia only lost in this conflict and failed to sign an association agreement with the European Union,"" Cavusoglu said. He said that the unresolved Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict remains the greatest problem standing in the way to peace and stability in the South Caucasus. ""We don't want war or problems with neighbors but they should also respect the territorial integrity of neighboring countries. In the first palce this applies to Armenia. We want peace and stability in the region,"" Cavusoglu said.

"BEIJING, August 16 (Itar-Tass) - Chinese president Xi Jinping said Saturday efforts should be made to prevent Ukraine from falling into humanitarian crisis, Xinhua reported. When meeting with Ban Ki-moon, secretary-general of the United Nations, Xi described the crash of a Malaysian plane in eastern Ukraine as an imperative to properly address the Ukrainian crisis, the agency said. On July 17, Malaysia Airlines flight MH17, a Boeing 777 en route from Amsterdam to Kuala lumpier, went down in eastern Ukraine, killing all 298 people on board. The cause of the incident remains unknown and the investigation cannot go smoothly due to the armed conflicts in the region. Xi urged all parties to negotiate for a programme that could take into consideration the interests of all parties in a balanced manner, Xinhua reported. He stressed that China continues to support the UN to play a major part in the process. Ban Ki-moon said that a political solution, rather than use of force, is the only right way to resolve the Ukrainian issue.

"BERLIN, September 26 (RIA Novosti) – The European Union and the World Bank could act as guarantors for the debt payments that Ukraine would be submitting to Russia under the plan proposed at the trilateral gas talks in Berlin Friday, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said. ""The funds that Ukraine received today from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which amount to $3.1 billion, could be used as a source of paying off the debt on the [Russian] gas deliveries, and the World Bank and the European Union can act as guarantors for the repayment of this debt,"" Novak told journalists after the talks. The European Union proposed that Ukraine pay Russia's Gazprom a total of $3.1 billion by the end of this year. This ""winter package"" also stipulates that Russia supply Ukraine 5 billion cubic meters of gas at a proposed price of $385 per 1,000 cubic meters for six months. Commenting on the proposals, Novak said that ""The Russian side and the European Union have practically no disagreements on these packages. It can be said that our positions are similar."" However, no final decisions have been made yet. Russia will hold direct talks with Ukraine on the issue of gas supplies next week, where the sides might come to an agreement. As a result of the ongoing political crisis in the country, Ukraine is currently on the verge of a default. Kiev authorities are trying to rescue the country's economy with international loans, including a $17 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund. Kiev has a significant gas debt that its gas company Naftogaz owes to Russian gas giant Gazprom, which is estimated to stand at over $5.3 billion. The IMF approved a loan to Ukraine in May in the form of a two-year stabilization program so that the country would be able to clear its debts, carry out economic reforms and recover. To receive the IMF funds in full, Ukraine agreed to a severe austerity program that includes shedding 24,000 government jobs, raising taxes, selling off state assets and withdrawing subsidies on natural gas.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Bratislava, April 4 (TASR) - Freedom and Solidarity (SaS) denounces any efforts on the part of Slovak or foreign senior state representatives to misuse the anniversary of Bratislava's liberation and the defeat of Nazi Germany to belittle and legitimise the violation of international law and aggression against neighbouring states, SaS's expert on foreign policy Martin Klus told TASR on Saturday [4 April]. Klus was referring to an official visit of Russian Foreign Affairs Minister Sergei Lavrov [Sergey Lavrov] to Slovakia on Saturday, during which the Russian minister - among other things - set off for Bratislava's Slavin War Memorial to pay respect to Soviet soldiers who died in the liberation of Bratislava towards the end of WWII. Klus went on to complain that at Lavrov's press conference with his Slovak counterpart Miroslav Lajcak earlier in the day the former talked about the conflict in Ukraine as if Russia had nothing to do with it and referred to Crimea as a Russian territory ""without hesitation"".

"BRISBANE, November 15 (RIA Novosti) - Russian President Vladimir Putin and UK Prime Minister David Cameron expressed their interest during the G20 summit in Brisbane, Australia in restoring the relations between Russia and the West as well as in finding measures for settling the Ukrainian crisis, Kremlin Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said. ""Even though the rather long talk was mainly on Ukraine, a conversation was held on the fundamental reasons behind the current problems in Russia's relations with the United States and a number of European countries. Besides, Putin and Cameron expressed their interest in restoring these relations and in undertaking measures for settling the Ukrainian crisis, which in turn would contribute to refraining from confrontational moods,"" Peskov told reporters Saturday. Tensions in relations between Russia and the West have started to build up since the very outset of the Ukrainian crisis. The Western community criticized Russia for allegedly playing a role in Ukraine’s internal political situation as well as for the reunification of Crimea with Russia. The condemnation by the United States, the European Union and a number of other countries was followed by several rounds of sanctions being imposed against Russia. All this happened despite assurances by Russia that it is no party to the crisis in Ukraine. Russia also repeatedly reminded that Crimea's reunification with Russia occurred merely by the volition of the territory's residents.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Brussels, Jan. 19 (Jiji Press)--Visiting Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida and senior European Union officials agreed Monday that Japan and the EU will strengthen their cooperation against terrorism in response to recent attacks in France. The EU officials, including Federica Mogherini, the EU's high representative for foreign affairs and security policy, referred to counterterrorism measures discussed at a meeting of EU foreign ministers earlier in the day. Terrorism should never be tolerated for any reason, Kishida told Mogherini. Kishida said Japan will provide 7.5 million dollars in aid for antiterrorism measures in the Middle East. He also explained Japan's security policy, including so-called proactive pacifism. In a statement issued after the meeting with Kishida, Mogherini said that the EU supports Japan ""in taking up more of its responsibilities on regional and global security."" ""We are expanding our joint peace and security agenda, cooperating in the context of EU crisis management operations and working together in crisis areas,"" the statement added. At a separate meeting with Frans Timmermans, first vice president of the European Commission, Kishida called on the EU to remove its import restrictions on agricultural products from Fukushima Prefecture and other parts of Japan that were introduced after the accident at Tokyo Electric Power Co.'s Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant damaged in the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami. Timmermans said that the EU is studying a positive response to the issue. Kishida and the EU officials agreed to work on setting up a Japan-EU summit for the first half of this year in Japan. Kishida also met with German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier. During the series of meetings, Kishida unveiled Japan' plans to offer additional financial assistance to Ukraine, citing the country's tough fiscal and economic conditions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"BRUSSELS, January 15 (Sputnik) - The European Union must keep the sanctions against Russia in place and adopt ""benchmarks"" that would allow them to be lifted, the European Parliament said in a press release following its plenary session on Thursday. ""[Members of the European Parliament] urge the EU Council at its March 2015 meeting to maintain current EU sanctions against Russia and approve 'benchmarks' for lifting them,"" the resolution read. According to the bloc's legislative body, these benchmarks should include ""respecting the ceasefire, unconditional withdrawal of Russian troops and illegal armed groups, exchanging all prisoners and restoring Ukraine's control over its whole territory, including Crimea."" The release added that ""in the event of further Russian actions destabilizing Ukraine"" restrictive measures would be further expanded to encompass the nuclear sector and international financial transactions in addition to existing banking, energy and defense sanctions. On Tuesday, European Council President Donald Tusk reiterated the EU's intention to review current anti-Russia sanctions in March. According to EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini and remarks made by other regional leaders, the lifting of anti-Russia sanctions is subject to the observation of the Minsk agreements on Ukraine and the stabilization of the situation in Donbas region. Russian authorities have repeatedly denied claims of involvement in Ukraine's internal affairs, a subject that led to the souring of relations between Moscow and the West in 2014. Several rounds of sanctions were adopted in Brussels, Washington and a number of allied states in response to Russia's alleged military support to southeast Ukraine's militia. These measures were met in August with Moscow's introduction of year-long food import bans from countries that imposed sanctions against it.

"BRUSSELS, September 3 (Itar-Tass) - Rallies in support of Ukraine’s cities of Donetsk and Lugansk in front of the European Parliament building in Brussels will be continued until the Right Sector is listed as a terrorist organization, Tatjana Zdanoka, a Latvian member of the European Parliament, told ITAR-TASS on Tuesday. A ""Stop Fascism"" picket was held in front of the European Parliament’s building on Tuesday. About 20 activists, both Russian and Ukrainian nationals and French and Belgian citizens, took part in the action. They were holding slogans ""Stop Fascism,"" ""Save Donetsk"" and a Russian flag. They demonstrated dozens of photos made on May 2 in the Ukrainian city of Odessa, where at least 48 protesters against the Kiev authorities had been burnt alive by radicals. ""We will stage such rallies on the second day of each month to commemorate the Odessa tragedy. We will be here until the Right Sector is listed as a terrorist organization,"" she said. ""Today, similar actions were held in Riga, Warsaw, Berlin, Copenhagen, London, Madrid, Milan. People learnt about these actions from anti-fascist organizations, from the European Russian Alliance."" ""There is a solid anti-fascist and anti-war movement in Europe involving tens of thousands of people. The main thing is that we know people who think the same way in all countries of the European Union. Despite the West’s massive pro-Kiev propaganda, there are a lot of people who do not believe it,"" Elena Politova, an activist and administrator of the Facebook anti-war group, said. Earlier on Tuesday, about a hundred people formed a human chain between the Russian and Ukrainian embassies in Riga in a Remembrance and Solidarity action dedicated to the May 2 massacre in the Ukrainian city of Odessa. The action was organized by activists of the party Latvian Russian Union. ""We gathered here not only to pay tribute to those killed on May 2 in Odessa, but also to demand that the Ukrainian government do two things. First, it must conduct a really objective investigation and punish those responsible for this tragedy. Second, it must do away with radical right organizations that are now flocking round power in Ukraine,"" Miroslav Mitrofanov, a co-chairman of the Latvian Russian Party, told ITAT-TASS. ""It is inadmissible to flirt with fascists, they must be controlled and kept away from the state. Otherwise, Ukraine will never be a democratic country."" Unrest in the southern Ukrainian port city of Odessa started on May 2, when football fans from the east Ukrainian city of Kharkov marched along city streets with Right Sector radicals and supporters from Kiev""s Maidan Self-Defence Force. Clashes broke out between them and activists seeking a referendum on the issue of Ukrainian federalisation and Russian""s official status as a state language. At least 48 people died and more than 200 were injured in clashes in Odessa after radicals set ablaze the regional House of Trade Unions, where pro-federalisation activists had taken refuge, and a tent camp near it where they had been collecting signatures in support of the referendum.

""A choice needs to be made here. There are borders that can't be crossed. If the border of free trade with the Customs Union is crossed, it will be a contradiction with the common market in the EU. There can be no contradictions. The thing is that a choice needs to be made,"" he said. At the same time, Linkevicius said the economic ties the EU has also need to be taken into account. ""If we look a the problem in an unpoliticized way, but in a practical way, the very wish to have good relations with both Russia and the EU is the only choice and there can be no other way.

"Budapest, June 16 (MTI) -- Once Europe's planned energy union is completed, it will ensure a supply of safe, comptitive, and sustainable energy to its citizens, Maros Sefcovic, vice-president of the European Commission, said in Budapest on Tuesday [16 June], adding that the current energy situation cannot be maintained. Sefcovic said that energy security for the European Union cannot be ensured unless member states diversify their energy sources. He noted that Hungary buys 80 percent of its gas solely from Russia's Gazprom. As part of the energy union, Hungary would be less dependent on a single gas or nuclear fuel supplier, while diversification would not only reduce risks of an outage but increase competition which could result in lower energy prices, Sefcovic said. The energy union and energy security are top priorities for the Commission, issues that need to be handled at community level and through a comprehensive approach, Sefcovic said. CEE, Hungary Still Vulnerable in Energy Security, Says [Sefcovic] Budapest, June 16 (MTI) -- Central and Eastern Europe, and Hungary as well, is still vulnerable from the point of view of energy security, the Hungarian foreign minister said, after meeting European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic in Budapest. Romania and Croatia have not yet carried out investments required for its interconnectors to ship natural gas despite relevant EU and bilateral agreements, Peter Szijjarto said after their talks. This makes building a gas delivery infrastructure difficult, he said. The government will do its utmost to cater for Hungary's energy security and will seek to serve that goal by linking the CEE region's electricity networks, the minister added. Among tasks for Hungary, he mentioned the creation of a large capacity strategic gas pipeline to link Central and Eastern Europe with Turkey. This would diversify not only the delivery routes, but the sources of supplies as well, he said. The interconnector linking Hungary and Slovakia can start shipping gas on July 1, Szijjarto said, noting that Hungary was the first EU member state to conclude an agreement with Ukraine on reverse gas deliveries. This served as a model for other member states on how Ukraine can be linked up with the community's energy market, he said. On another subject Szijjarto confirmed the government's position on the utility cuts scheme. There will be no increase in utility fees ""as long as you see us in this post,"" he said, adding that the government seeks to reach an agreement with the EU that would not lead to a fee hike. The EC vice president said he highly appreciated Hungary's ""constructive and responsible"" approach towards the interconnector projects. These pipelines must be made suitable for reverse gas transmission as soon as possible, he said. Sefcovic visited Hungary as part of his tour of EU member states with- a mission to present the opportunities that the Energy Union will bring to European citizens and businesses.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Monex Investindo Futures analyst Zulfirman Basir said the confidence among market players in the hope of a smooth presidential election result announcement, slated to be conducted on Tuesday, had created positive sentiment in the domestic market. He said the improvement had also been triggered by foreign capital continuing to enter the country, despite the crises in Ukraine and the Middle East. However, he added that the rupiah remained volatile, since the global price of crude oil was still above US$100 per barrel. The possibility of increasing tension in Ukraine and the Middle East in the near future would likely increase the price of crude oil further, he explained, thus affecting Indonesia's trade balance and current account.

""The punitive measures that the current Kyiv leadership has taken against its own people attest to its inability or unwillingness to deliver on the obligations it assumed under the Geneva statement of April 17 in favor of putting an end to any violence and starting a broad nationwide dialogue involving all regions and political forces as soon as possible,"" Churkin said.

"By Lukas I. Alpert MOSCOW--A shootout erupted early Sunday at a roadblock outside an eastern Ukrainian city that has become the focal point of a pro-Russian separatist movement, with varying reports of casualties. The incident represented the first reported bloodshed in the region since Ukraine, Russia, the U.S. and the European Union signed a joint agreement on Thursday in Geneva to try to stabilize the situation in eastern Ukraine, where pro-Russian militants have taken control of 10 cities. Following the agreement, Ukraine said it would halt a military operation to regain control of the region over the Easter holiday. Ukraine's interior ministry said one person was killed and three wounded in a gunbattle just north of Slovyansk around 3 a.m. between two groups, but gave no further details. Russian news agencies, citing officials with the pro-Russian militia that seized control of the city last weekend, reported that up to five people had been killed--three who were guarding the checkpoint and two who had opened fire from inside a pair of vehicles as they approached the roadblock. Photos from the scene showed two vehicles bearing Ukrainian license plates that appeared entirely gutted by fire. A report on Russia's state-run news channel Rossiya 24, citing no source, stated that a large quantity of arms--including explosives, smoke bombs, U.S.-made night-vision goggles and aerial maps of the region were found inside the cars. The report also said that materials found in the car were linked to a small Ukrainian ultranationalist group, Pravy Sektor, which has repeatedly been held up by Russia as a sign that Ukraine has been overrun by armed fascists who are threatening the rights of ethnic Russians. Little evidence of such threats, however, has ever emerged. The report prompted a statement from the Russian foreign ministry repeating Rossiya 24's details of what was found in the cars and blaming the new government in Kiev of failing to rein in and disarm ""nationalists and extremists."" ""It is astonishing that this tragedy happened after the signing of the April 17th Geneva declaration...which calls for refraining from all acts of violence, intimidation and provocation,"" the statement said. ""Russia insists that Ukraine sticks to its commitments to de-escalate the situation in the southeast."" Viktoria Syumar, deputy head of Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, called reports blaming Pravy Sektor ""propaganda"" intended to support the argument that Ukraine has plunged into civil war in order to justify a possible Russian invasion in the future. Russia has moved tens of thousands of troops close to the Ukrainian border and has repeatedly said it reserves the right to defend the interests of ethnic Russians living in eastern Ukraine. On Friday, pro-Russian militants refused to vacate government buildings they have occupied as the Geneva agreement calls for them to do, undermining the effectiveness of the deal at the outset.

"Churkin: Russia expects Kyiv to take real steps towards peace UNITED NATIONS (New York City). Aug 29 (Interfax) - Moscow expects Kyiv to take real steps towards resolution of the conflict in Ukraine, Russian Permanent Representative to the United Nations Vitaly Churkin said. ""President Petro Poroshenko has repeatedly made peace-loving statements. He has also mentioned a certain new urgent settlement plan, but where is this plan?

May 16 (Interfax) - Border department heads of CIS member countries will discuss suppression of terrorism and illegal immigration and security of CIS borders at the 69th meeting of the Council of CIS Border Force Commanders. ""Ukraine's hosting of the 69th meeting of the Council is of paramount importance for the Ukrainian border department. We value the Council work towards coordinated efforts of CIS border agencies and deterrence of modern threats and challenges of terrorism and illegal immigration to national security along CIS borders,"" Ukrainian State Border Service Head Mykola Lytvyn told a Thursday press briefing in Odesa.

In turn, Chairman of the Coordination Service of the Council of CIS Border Force Commanders Alexander Manilov said the meeting would discuss anti-drug measures and special border operations. ""The Council will ponder eleven major issues today related to operations of border departments and security along CIS borders and sign over 20 documents pertaining to border security.

"CIS NEWS No plans to cut Russian-Belarusian Union State programs - head Manifestations of a crisis in the Russian and Belarusian economies will not lead to cuts in the Union State's budget, or a reassessment of the package of joint programs, said state secretary of the Union State, Grigory Rapota. ""The figures remain unchanged. No proposals have been made to cut the budget or Union programs,"" Rapota told reporters in Minsk on Tuesday. He also said that the Union programs were aimed at developing innovative products and rested on the two countries' scientific and industrial potentials, and therefore depend on imports to a smaller degree. ""The crisis will not have an effect on Union programs, I am sure, except the fact, perhaps, that our currency exchange rates have changed,"" Rapota said. The Belarusian-Russian integration projects remain in force, despite the crisis, he also said. ""They remain on the agenda and progress has been made in fulfilling the tasks set,"" he said. The work to implement the integration projects ""will be discussed by the Union Council of Ministers, to convene in the first half of the year, and will be discussed in contacts between the prime ministers,"" he said. President Ilham Aliyev has ordered to adjust pension insurance for inflation, according to a statement on his website. The insurance component of employment-based pensions will now be adjusted for the 2014 inflation. The average annual pension in Azerbaijan in 2014 stood at 1.4%. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko had a telephone conversation on Tuesday. ""Issues of mutual interest were discussed during the conversation,"" the Belarusian state news agency BelTA reported. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko will give a press conference for Belarusian and foreign journalists on January 29, the Belarusian presidential press service told Interfax. It is expected that 260 journalists from 152 newspapers, 16 news agencies, three online media, 26 TV channels, 41 radio stations will take part in the press conference. A total of 142 journalists will represent Belarusian regions. The governments of Belarus and Russia are drafting a joint action plan to deal with the economic crisis. The plan is to be submitted for discussion at a meeting of the Supreme State Council of the Union State, tentatively set for early march, said Belarusian Prime Minister Andrei Kobyakov. ""I guess the Supreme State Council will convene soon, in early March. We must ready ourselves for the current economic conditions. The two governments are drafting a joint economic-policy action plan which is expected to give them levers to find a worthy and well-coordinated response to the crisis,"" Kobyakov told Grigory Rapota, state secretary of the Belarusian-Russian Union State, in Minsk on Tuesday. He also said that both countries have certain ideas readied, and experts are working on them. The Belarusian and Russian finance and economics ministries, and central banks are maintaining intensive contacts, as well, he said. ""Certain problems have cropped up in bilateral relations, as well, which found themselves in the limelight last year. We didn't expect them to arise in the Customs Union,"" the Belarusian prime minister said. Hopefully, these issues will be discussed today, he said. The presidents of Kyrgyzstan and Mongolia, Almazbek Atambayev and Tsakhia Elbegdorj, respectively, have been discussing bilateral cooperation. ""On Tuesday Atambayev met with Mongolian President Elbegdorj, who is in Kyrgyzstan on a working visit,"" the Kyrgyz head of state's press office told Interfax. At the meeting, the parties discussed the bilateral Kyrgyz-Mongolian cooperation in various areas, the spokesperson said.. ""The presidents called for further intensification of political dialogue between Kyrgyzstan and Mongolia and for broader bilateral cooperation in trade, economy and culture,"" the spokesperson added. Moldovan President Nicolae Timofti started political consultations with the parliamentary factions on Tuesday concerning the nomination of a candidate for prime minister. Timofti planned to meet on Tuesday with the deputies of four factions, i.e. that of the Liberal-Democratic Party of Moldova (LDPM), the Democratic Party (DPM), the Liberal Party, and the Party of Communists, the presidential press service told Interfax. The president had earlier met with the parliamentarians from the Party of Socialists, which had refused to take part in forming the government or nominate a prime ministerial candidate, the press service said. The Socialists, who control 25 out of the 101 parliamentary mandates, had said on Monday they would be in stiff opposition to the ruling majority and would not support any of its decisions in the parliament. The LDPM and DPM agreed last Friday on setting up the Alliance for European Moldova holding 42 (23+19) out of the 101 mandates. The two parties declared their intention to set up a minority government with support from the Party of Communists, whose faction numbers 20 deputies. The decision was made after the LDPM and DPM had failed to reach an agreement on setting up a parliamentary majority with the Liberal Party (13 mandates). The Alliance for European Moldova, supported by the Party of Communists faction, unblocked the parliament's work last Friday by electing its speaker and governing bodies nearly two months after the parliamentary elections. The establishment of the government is supposed to be the next step for the parliament. Article 98 of the Moldovan constitution stipulates that the president is expected to nominate a candidate for prime minister after conducting consultations with all factions. Within 15 days after the nomination, the candidate is supposed to ask the parliament to pass a vote of confidence in the government's composition and program. Based on a vote of confidence, the president is to endorse the government. Article 85 of the Moldovan constitution stipulates that, if a government is not formed after the president's consultations with the parliamentary factions, the president is entitled to dissolve the parliament. The parliament can also be dissolved if it fails to pass a vote of confidence in a government at least twice within 45 days after its composition and program were proposed. The agreement on putting together the Alliance for European Moldova says that the LDPM will nominate a candidate for prime minister. LDPM Chairman Vlad Filat told journalists that incumbent Prime Minister Iurie Leanca would remain the candidate for prime minister and the government would be formed within two weeks. Attempts to rewrite history, including Holocaust events, are impermissible and amoral, Russian President Vladimir Putin said. ""Such crimes cannot and do not have an expiration date, an excuse or oblivion. Any attempts to keep silent about these events, to distort or rewrite history are impermissible and amoral,"" Putin said at the Moscow Jewish Museum and Tolerance Center. ""A wish to conceal one's shame, the shame of cowardice, hypocrisy and treasury, and to find an excuse for direct or indirect silent connivance with the criminal policy of the Nazi are often behind these attempts,"" the chief of state added. The danger of double standards in the resolution of global problems has manifested itself with renewed vigor in southeastern Ukraine, President Vladimir Putin said. ""History shows to what dangerous line mankind can be brought by aspirations of world dominance and what military pressure on sovereign states and disrespect for their rights can be fraught with,"" he said, speaking at the Moscow Jewish Museum and Tolerance Center on Tuesday. ""And we also know the dangerous and destructive nature of double standards and indifference towards the fate of others, which has been exhibited in today's tragedy in southeastern Ukraine where civilians of Donbas, Luhansk, have been being killed in cold blood for months,"" Putin highlighted. ""A crime the scale of the Holocaust must never be repeated. This is our duty and it would not be an exaggeration to say that this is the most important and pressing task of the entire international community,"" Putin said. ""Enormous changes have taken place on the international scene over past decades but we can still see hateful ideas across the globe,"" he said. ""We are still encountering attempts to split society over nationality, race or religion, as well as anti-Semitism, Russophobia and aggressive intolerance towards other peoples, cultures and traditions,"" the chief of state said. In the past ""these primitive instincts were used by the Nazi regime and now they have been adopted by nationalists, extremists and terrorists operating in some countries and regions of the world."" ""We need to resist these threats together, to protect peace and freedom together and to defend the right of states to choose their own development path,"" Putin emphasized. President Vladimir Putin said ""social stability"" must be the main objective of the crisis plan being prepared by Russia's government. ""Because it's called an anti-crisis plan, we realize that above all it must guarantee social stability. But this objective can only be attained if acceptable economic parameters are maintained,"" Putin said at a government conference in Moscow on Monday. He said he was referring to inflation and foreign debt levels, budgetary principles and amounts of emergency reserves. ""That is all that we have justifiably been proud of in recent years. The name of it is macroeconomic stability. It must become the basis for economic growth as one of the conditions for private investment,"" Putin said. He called for revisions of state spending in order ""to increase the financing of some of the economic sectors the way this was done in 2008-2009."" ""We should look at our priorities once again,"" he said. President Vladimir Putin has given the economy ministers in the Cabinet seven days to meet with lawmakers to discuss the parameters of the anti-crisis plan. ""The prime minister plans to confirm this plan tomorrow. I would ask you to meet with State Duma deputies in the coming week to discuss all parameters of this plan in order to ensure the maximum consolidation of the executive and legislative branches of authority,"" Putin told the Cabinet on Monday. Putin said that he was planning to discuss the ideas proposed by the economy ministers in the Cabinet during the meeting. Putin is expected to confirm the anti-crisis plan. Russian President Vladimir Putin, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande discussed the latest sharp escalation of tensions in south-eastern Ukraine over the phone, the Kremlin press service has reported. ""The president of Russia reiterated that the reason for this was the Kyiv authorities' policy aimed at suppressing Donbas by force,"" the press service said. Putin noted that on January 15, he had forwarded a letter to Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, proposing the immediate withdrawal of the sides' heavy weapons from the line of contact in an attempt to prevent further shelling of residential areas and further civilian casualties. ""A formal response to this message arrived only today. And, prior to this, large-scale fighting had been launched, resulting in a catastrophic deterioration of the situation in the south-east,"" the press service said. During these telephone conversations, Putin reaffirmed the extreme importance of establishing political dialogue between the Kyiv authorities and representatives of Donetsk and Luhansk in order to stop the bloodshed and help settle the internal Ukrainian crisis, the press service said. Moscow is ""cautiously optimistic"" about a recent meeting in Donetsk at which Viktor Medvedchuk, Ukrainian Choice public organization head, represented Ukraine on the orders of President Petro Poroshenko. He met with the leaders of the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk people's republics, Alexander Zakharchenko and Igor Plotnitsky, Kremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov said. The sides held preliminary consultations ahead of the Minsk negotiations ""primarily because, against the backdrop of offensive operations of the Ukrainian side, the DPR and LPR representatives were reported to have expressed extreme skepticism about prospects of the Minsk process,"" Peskov said. The Donetsk consultations were also attended by militia representatives to the Minsk negotiations Denis Pushilin and Vladislav Deinego. ""Moscow regrets that representatives of the Ukrainian army and Ukrainian presidential advisor Ruslan Demchenko who were planned to appear at the Donetsk meeting changed their mind at the very last moment and did not come to the negotiations,"" Peskov said. ""Moscow hopes that the discussion started at the preliminary consultations in Donetsk will be continued, for instance, in regards to such subjects as the ceasefire, the pullback of artillery and missile systems from the demarcation line, the launch of work to determine the demarcation line and the prisoner exchange,"" the Russian president's press secretary stated. ""The appointment of an official representative to the Minsk negotiations by Kyiv will contribute to the achievement of these goals a lot,"" he opined. Standard & Poor's decision to lower Russia's investment rating was politically motivated, and all of such ratings should be looked at as political tools, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said at a meeting on livestock in Bryansk. ""All of these ratings everyone is talking a lot about now are obviously a purely political tool,"" he said. Medevedev said he was saying this ""not just because such decisions have been reached with respect to our country."" ""Let's think about how these ratings are formed,"" he said. ""A number of states impose restrictions against the economies of other states, in this case against our economy, that is, they take, of course, political decisions. And then, on this basis, the conclusion is made that a specific economy is working not entirely as it ought to, that economy is not coping with something. And it is on the basis of this that decisions are made to lower ratings,"" he said. ""Is this not a political decision? He said. ""We'll get over all this,"" he said. ""But it's bad that in general, this complicates the situation in the country, and let's be frank, in the world,"" he said. ""You and I have to work out pinpoint solutions that will help our economy in these conditions,"" Medvedev said. Russia is not experiencing a food deficit, but the situation with prices needs to be controlled and solutions must be found, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev told journalists at a meeting on livestock on Tuesday. ""There have already been certain successes as concerns replacing imports. It must be said that in any case our store shelves aren't empty, and they are being filled more and more by Russian products,"" he said. ""There is not a deficit for goods that people kept talking about. It's clear there's an issue with prices, and this requires separate control and separate decisions. But there's not a deficit,"" Medvedev added. Discussing support for the livestock industry over the last several years, Medvedev said that 390 billion rubles were allocated for these purposes in 2008-2014. As a result, meat consumption in the country was 75 kilograms per person per year in 2014, which is in line with the ""recommended rational norm."" ""I hope that this year, despite current difficulties, livestock will have decent prospects,"" Medvedev said. Russian agriculture is capable of not only meeting the domestic needs of the country, but also of supplying food for export, which needs to be stimulated, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said. ""Russia, of course, is capable of not only feeding itself, but also of carrying out exports,"" Medvedev said at a meeting on the development of animal husbandry on Tuesday. He said that in 2014 the export of live stock products increased by almost 50% compared with 2013. ""It will be necessary to adopt additional measures for the stimulus of exports. Of course, this will be after filling our market with high-quality products. But exports are also an important topic so that we can provide producers with opportunity to earn money in foreign currency and advertise our opportunities. Therefore it will also be necessary to engage in this, including the Economic Development Ministry,"" the prime minister said. Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said Russia's reaction to any decision to restrict the participation of Russian banks in the SWIFT system would be tough and unlimited. ""If such decisions are reached, I'd like to say that our economic reaction, and any other for that matter, will be unlimited,"" Medvedev said at a meeting in Bryansk. He said that apart from a lack of budgeted funds, there was an ""additional set of restrictions, which we've also already come up against - finance, liquidity restrictions."" ""The foreign money markets are closed, and that of course reflects on the domestic situation,"" he said. ""And we are constantly being threatened with additional retribution against our banking system - yet again, restrictions related to SWIFT are being discussed,"" he said. ""Well, we'll just have to wait and see what will happen,"" Medvedev said. President Petro Poroshenko has informed the representatives of factions of the Verkhovna Rada coalition about the results of the meeting of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine (NSDC) on January 25. The NSDC suggested amending the laws aimed at the establishment of military-civilian administrations in the populated areas of Donetsk and Luhansk regions, the press service of the president reported. ""This will let us resolve the issue of absence of authorities in the liberated territories, when all deputies of local councils, who supported separatist positions and committed crimes, have absconded from justice,"" the head of state noted. In this regard, Poroshenko said that military-civilian administrations would perform the local government functions, until the elections of competent representative authorities were held. According to him, not only members of the military, but also civilians with relevant experience can be appointed. The main criterion is the capability of being responsible for the solution of security and humanitarian problems of people in the liberated territories. Poroshenko stressed that the humanitarian situation was especially complicated in the areas severely affected by constant shelling. The security of important infrastructure facilities in eastern and southern regions must be increased, particularly in Kharkiv, Odesa, Kherson, Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhia, Mykolaiv, Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Prime Minister Arseniy Yatseniuk, who was also present at the meeting, has informed about the decision of the Cabinet of Ministers to impose emergency rule in Donetsk and Luhansk regions, based on the results of the meeting of the NSDC and in accordance with the President's order. The government has also upgraded the regime of emergency response all over Ukraine up to the ""full readiness"". The Prime Minister said that the inventory of all objects of civilian protection had been initiated that day. According to the preliminary examination, held over the past two months, half of them are not prepared to take people in. One of the reasons, the lack of funding, is planned to be solved at the cost of the government's reserve fund. ""The main reason is that nobody cared about this during last 20 years,"" the Prime Minister said. The meeting was also attended by Verkhovna Rada Chairman Volodymyr Hroisman, NSDC Secretary Oleksandr Turchynov, faction leader of the party ""Bloc of Petro Poroshenko"" Yuriy Lutsenko, Batkivschyna party leader Yulia Tymoshenko, Radical Party leader Oleh Liashko, Samopomich faction leader Oleh Bereziuk and first deputy leader of the People's Front party Andriy Teteruk. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has expressed hope in a telephone conversation with the EU High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy that the trilateral contact group for the Donbas settlement will meet soon to make it possible to promote further dialog at the highest level, the Ukrainian presidential press service reported. Ukraine has remained committed to the peaceful resolution of the situation in Donbas and speaks for the fulfillment of the Minsk accords by all parties, Poroshenko said. Poroshenko also thanked Mogherini for her effort to convene an extraordinary meeting of the EU Foreign Affairs Council and discuss the EU's reaction to the shelling of Mariupol. Mogherini in turn expressed hope that the EU Council of Foreign Ministers will be able to reach a constructive consensus. The parties also agreed to continue close coordination of effort to assist a comprehensive peaceful settlement in Donbas, the Ukrainian presidential press service reported. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko spoke with European Council President Donald Tusk on the phone on Monday night, the presidential press service reported. ""Petro Poroshenko told Donald Tusk about the events happening in Donbas after the terror attack in Mariupol. He thanked the European Council President for his strong support for Ukraine,"" the report said. The sides coordinated their positions in view of the January 29 sitting of the Foreign Affairs Council. ""The Ukrainian President also informed the European Council President about the progress made by Ukraine in the second stage of the visa liberalization action plan and urged the European Union to make a political decision and approve a visa-free travel regime for Ukrainian citizens visiting Schengen countries at the May summit of the Eastern Partnership in Riga,"" the report underlined. In addition, Poroshenko called on the EU to enlarge macro-financial assistance to Ukraine and discussed issues related to a donor conference due in April 2015. Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatseniuk has addressed the organizers and participants of the ""Six Millions of Hearts"" event which commemorates the victims of the Holocaust during the Second World War, the Cabinet of Ministers' press service has reported. ""Dear Friends! January 27, 2015 is the date of the 70th anniversary of the liberation of prisoners from the death camp at Auschwitz, where in a short time two million people were exterminated, with the majority of them being Jews. The decision of the United Nations is to mark this day as International Holocaust Remembrance Day…While commemorating on this day we pay the tribute to the six million victims of the Holocaust, we remember with sorrow the hundreds of thousands who were killed, tortured and exterminated on the territory of Ukraine in those terrible years: Jews, Romanians, Ukrainians and other nationalities,"" the premier said. ""We honor those who survived in those inhuman conditions and brought to us the awful truth about where an ideology built on ideas of hatred and fanaticism, the superiority of one nation over others leads. We strongly condemn all crimes against the Jewish people, all cases of anti-Semitism, genocide, ethnic and religious intolerance,"" he said. ""These days, when Ukraine is suffering from military aggression, and the terrorists commit reprisals, and sometimes murders basing on national or religious grounds, we again and again declare the commitment of our people to build our future on the principles of tolerance and mutual respect, respect for the freedom and uniqueness of a person,"" the premier said.

"CONTENTS OIL Rosneft ups oil production 45% to intl standards in 7M MOSCOW. Aug 6 (Interfax) - Russian oil major Rosneft increased oil production to international standards by 45% year-on-year in January-July - to a little over 102 million tonnes, company materials say. By Russian standards, Rosneft increased output 43.8% to 104.245 million tonnes. Rosneft is now factoring in production by TNK-BP, which it finalized the purchase of this past March. MOSCOW. Aug 1 (Interfax) - RN-Holding, formerly TNK-BP Holding made 33.5 billion rubles in first-half net profits, a 60% drop from the 85 billion rubles it earned for the same period last year, the company reported. Sales revenues, on the other hand, rose 4.5% year-on-year to 526 billion rubles. Cost of product sold increased even more - almost 19% to 451 billion rubles. Earnings ""from involvement in other organizations"" amounted to 57 billion rubles for H1 2012, where that figure for this year was just 387 million rubles. RN-Holding's gross profits dropped 37.5% to 75 billion rubles and sales profits almost by two thirds to 28 billion rubles for the half. Pretax profits slumped 54.6% to almost 40 billion rubles. MOSCOW. Aug 2 (Interfax) - Alexander Nekipelov, the chairman of the board of directors at Rosneft, has acquired a 0.0008% stake in the Russian state-owned oil producer, the company reported. Nikolai Laverov, a member of the board of directors who, like Nekipelov, previously had no ownership in the company, acquired a 0.0007% stake on July 31. Another member of the board, Artur Warnig, raised his stake in Rosneft from 0.0002% to 0.0009% on the same date. According to Rosneft's press service, Nekipelov, Laverov and Warnig received their stakes as remuneration for serving as independent directors. MOSCOW. Aug 2 (Interfax) - The board of directors of Lukoil will meet on August 8 to discuss preparations for an upcoming extraordinary shareholder meeting, the independent Russian oil producer said in a statement. Lukoil's press service declined to comment on the topic. Lukoil President Vagit Alekperov recently said the board of directors would mull over interim dividends in September. ""There should be a board meeting and later a shareholder meeting on interim dividends, like last year,"" he said. He said dividends will be paid out for the first half of the year. Last year Lukoil made the decision to pay out interim dividends. For 2012 the oil producer shelled out 50 rubles per ordinary share in dividends, which did not include interim dividends of 40 rubles per ordinary share. Altogether, dividends came to 90 rubles per ordinary share, an increase of 20% over payouts for the previous year (75 rubles for 2011). Lukoil's charter capital comprises 850.563 million shares. According to the company's dividend policy, it is to earmark at least 15% of profit to GAAP for dividends. Alekperov has promised to give shareholders 23% of net profit for annual dividends. Lukoil later plans to boost that share to 30%, then by 2021 to 40%. MOSCOW. Aug 6 (Interfax) - Gazprom Neft made net profits to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) of 77.621 billion rubles in the first half of 2013, 1.4% less than in the same period last year, the company reported. Analysts surveyed by Interfax had anticipated the company would make 75.9 billion rubles. The company's second-quarter net profits were up 25% year-on-year at 38.054 billion rubles. The analysts had predicted 36.3 billion rubles. ""The company's financial performance in H1 2013 compared to H1 2012 was positively affected by growth in hydrocarbon production and a rise in petroleum products sales via premium distribution channels. The impact of these factors led to a 1.8% year-on-year increase in revenue and a 0.9% year-on-year increase in adjusted EBITDA. The 1.4% year-on-year decrease in profit attributable to Gazprom Neft's shareholders was related to foreign exchange losses due to the revaluation of the credit portfolio, as well as a rise in depreciation expenses resulting from the investment program,"" the company said. ""An increase in production volumes, refining throughput and domestic petroleum product sales drove revenue up by 2.4% quarter-on-quarter. Falling crude oil and oil product prices, combined with the negative impact of the export duty lag in Q2 2013 drove a 3.7% quarter-on-quarter decrease in adjusted EBITDA and a 3.8% quarter-on-quarter decrease in profit attributable to Gazprom Neft's shareholders,"" it said. ""Hydrocarbon production volumes in H1 2013 increased by 3.6% year-on-year to 224.87 mmboe (30.61 mmtoe), due to the ongoing development of major projects (Orenburg, SeverEnergia), continued production growth at the Priobskoye field, and the successful application of high-tech operations at mature fields, as well as programs aimed at improving associated petroleum gas utilization,"" the company said. ""Refining throughput decreased 0.8% year-on-year to 21.19 million tonnes in H1 2013 due to planned maintenance. Sales via premium distribution channels reached 10.98 million tonnes, and average daily sales per petrol station in Russia grew by 9% to 18 tonnes/day,"" it said. ""Capex increased by 31.3% year-on-year, driven mainly by new project development and the use of new technology to maintain production at mature fields,"" Gazprom Neft said. Gazprom Neft reduced purchases of oil in Russia by 33% year-on-year to 2.66 million tonnes in the first half of 2013, the company reported. Gazprom Neft attributes the reduction to the end of its oil supply contract with TNK-BP, which was bought by state oil major Rosneft in March. Gazprom Neft deputy head for refining, logistics and sales Anatoly Cherner said earlier that Rosneft broke off the contract to supply 200,000 tonnes of TNK-BP crude per month to Gazprom Neft's Omsk Oil Refinery. Gazprom Neft also said in its report that it had reduced oil purchases on the international market by 30.8% to 74,000 tonnes due to the reduction of trading operations. At the same time, the company increased purchases of oil products on the international market by 52.8% to 1.1 million tonnes in the first half due to an increase in trading operations. Purchases of oil products on the domestic market increased by 16.5% to 92,000 tonnes due to scheduled repairs at Gazprom Neft refineries. Gazprom Neft's overall crude sales fell 21% to 6.88 million tonnes in the first half, with exports dropping 35.7% to 4.29 million tonnes due to the redistribution of export sales in CIS countries and a reduction in trading operations. Sales of oil products, meanwhile, rose 3.8% to 22.41 million tonnes. Exports rose 18.7% to 8.2 million tonnes and sales on the international market grew 26.2% to 1.35 million tonnes, while domestic sales dropped 4% to 11.83 million tonnes, and exports and sales in CIS countries fell 20% to 1.03 million tonnes. Gazprom Neft extracted 224.87 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) in the first half of this year, a 3.6% increase on H1 of 2012, the company reported. The board of directors of Gazprom Neft has deferred its discussion of interim dividends to the fall, CFO Alexei Yankevich said during a conference call. The board was supposed to consider interim dividends this month. Gazprom Neft decided this year to start paying out interim dividends after previously only paying out dividends once for the year as a whole. Gazprom Neft shareholders received 9.3 rubles per share in dividends for 2012, totaling 44.09 billion rubles, or 25% of net consolidated profit to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Gazprom, which controls slightly more than 95% of the oil producer's shares, is the primary recipient of dividends. MOSCOW. Aug 1 (Interfax) - Surgutneftegas increased its net earnings to Russian Accounting Standards (RAS) by 52% year-on-year to 154.223 billion rubles in the first half of the 2013, company materials say. Meanwhile, revenues declined 3.7% to 378.199 billion rubles, but cost of goods sold decreased 2.8% to 255.122 billion rubles. Gross profit was down 5.6% to 123.077 billion rubles, and sales profit dropped 11% to 88.28 billion rubles. However, profit before tax soared 50% to 185.831 billion rubles. KAZAN. Aug 6 (Interfax) - OJSC Tatneft produced 15.15 million tonnes of oil in Tatarstan in January-July 2013, a 0.2% increase over the same period last year and 2.7% above plan, the company said in a press release. In July alone, the company boosted oil production 0.7% year-on-year to 2.218 million tonnes. Tatneft slashed well drilling by 11.8% in the seven-month period to 334,700 meters, including a 8.4% decline for Tatneft itself to 258,300 meters and a 36.3% drop for its subsidiaries to 21,800 meters. The company built and delivered 215 wells to customers, down 3.2% year-on-year. That included 151 wells built and delivered by Tatneft (159 wells in the same period last year) and 18 wells built and delivered by its subsidiaries (17). OJSC TANECO, a subsidiary of Tatneft, refined 730,500 tonnes of crude oil (up 17.5% year-on-year and 5.2% against June) and produced 725,500 tonnes of petroleum products (also up 17.5%) in July, the press release said. IRKUTSK. Aug 7 (Interfax) - The administration of Irkutsk region has signed an agreement on cooperation with AFK Sistema, the regional government said in a press release. The agreement covers cooperation in the forest products and oil and gas sectors, as well as in high tech, creation of innovation-technology parks, and telecommunications, including expansion of broadband internet access and other communications systems. ""The two parties to the cooperation agreement will strive to coordinate their operations to attract investment to the Irkutsk region to achieve priority goals in socioeconomic development and strengthen the region's scientific-innovation potential,"" the press release says. Irkutsk region Governor Sergei Yeroshchenko signed the agreement with AFK Sistema board chairman Vladimir Yevtushenkov. AFK Sistema owns and manages a portfolio of investments in businesses in various industries. Its most significant assets lie in the telecommunications industry (MTS and SSTL), the fuel and energy complex (Bashneft), transport (SG-Trans), electronics (OJSC RTI) and the media sector (SMM). It also develops in other areas, including retail trade (Detsky Mir), finance (MTS-Bank), medical services (Medsi), pharmaceuticals and biotechnology (Binnopharm), tourism (Intourist) and agriculture. AFK Sistema's largest shareholder is founder and board chairman Vladimir Yevtushenkov, with 64.19% of shares. Nineteen percent of its shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange. MOSCOW. Aug 7 (Interfax) - The Swedish company Lundin Petroleum extracted 2,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in Russia in the first half of this year, a 14% decrease, the company said. Overall, Lundin edged up hydrocarbon production 0.3% to 35,200 boepd, mainly due to a 27% increase in gas production, to 7,500 boepd. Oil production alone declined 5% in the six months to 27,700 bpd. In Russia, Lundin owns a 50% stake in the development of the Sotchemyu-Talyu deposit and the North Irael deposit in Komi and a 70% stake in the Lagansky block developer, Petroresurs LLC (oil trader Gunvor has the other 30%). A license to prospect this block valid until next August has been issued. But the company cannot extend it or obtain a production license, as by law only companies with more than 50% state involvement and over five years' experience operating in Russian waters can develop Russian shelf deposits. Lundin has been trying to get this matter settled for quite a while. In 2007, Gazprom was planning to join the development of the block. The Russian gas giant even signed a call-option agreement with Lundin concerning the acquisition of 50% plus one share in Petroresurs, but it was not exercised. In March of 2011, Lundin reiterated that it was negotiating the sale of this block, but to whom it did not say. ""In the Lagansky Block in the northern Caspian a major oil discovery, Morskaya, was made in 2008. The discovery is deemed to be strategic by the Russian Government, due to its offshore location, under the Foreign Strategic Investment Law (FSIL). As a result a 50 percent ownership by a state owned company is required prior to appraisal and development. Discussions continue with third parties to meet the requirements of the FSIL,"" Lundin said in its H1 report. Gunvor has said it is prepared to sell its 30% stake in Petroresurs. The Russian oil was sold both at home and abroad in the first half. Imports accounted for 46% of total oil production at an average price of $107/barrel. It sold for $55/barrel on the domestic market. Overall oil sales declined 11.5% to 4.8 million barrels in the six months. The average sale price was $107/barrel, down from $112/barrel a year earlier. Gas sales rose 22% to 1.4 million barrels of oil equivalent. The average price was $63/barrel, up from $57/barrel. Net profit plunged 50% to $48.2 million and earnings per share fell to $0.16 from $0.37 in the same period last year. EBITDA was down 10% to $520.2 million and revenue of $627.8 million, down 8%. By the end of the year, production could rise to 40,000 boepd (about 2 million tonnes a year), 5% above target, Lundin said in a presentation. The company previously said it planned to increase hydrocarbon production 6.4% to 38,000 boepd. Lundin confirmed that 2013 capex would total $150 million for appraisal and $460 million for exploration, including $120 million in seismic surveying and $340 million in drilling. Spending on geological exploration rose 340% in the first half of the year to $134.3 million, due to implementation of new projects in Norway. Lundin plans to launch oil production at Brynhild, in which the company is the project operator with a 90% stake, in the fourth quarter of 2013. Reserves at the field (2P) are estimated at 23.1 million barrels of oil equivalent, and production is projected to plateau at 12,000 boepd. First oil from another project on the Norwegian shelf - Boyla - is expected in Q4 2014. The 2P reserves are estimated at up to 22 million boe, with a production plateau of 19,000 boepd. Lundin has a 15% stake in the project. One year later, it expects to receive first oil at Edvard Grieg, where Lundin is the project operator with a 50% stake. The other 50% is held by OMV (20%), Wintershall (15%) and Statoil (15%). The 2P reserves are estimated at up to 186 million boe with a production plateau projected to total 100,000 boepd. TOMSK. Aug 5 (Interfax) - The management at India's Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) Videsh Ltd., or OVL, has appointed to the post of Imperial Energy, a part of OVL that extracts oil in Tomsk Region, the senior engineer at Nord Imperial, part of Imperial Energy, Alexander Karataev. He assumed his new duties on August 2, Imperial Energy said in a statement. Nord Imperial sources told Interfax that Karataev replaces Igor Goncharov, the reason for whose departure the company is not commenting on. Interfax has been unable to contact Goncharov. ""Mr. Karataev has passed his professional path in oil and gas industry in Tomsk region from the position of geological engineer to General Director of LLC Archinskoye. On November 1st, 2010 he became a Chief Engineer of LLC Nord Imperial. On August 2nd, 2013 Management of OVL appointed Mr. Karataev to the position of General Director of Imperial Energy Group (LLC Nord Imperial, LLC Allianceneftegaz, LLC Sibinterneft, LLC Stratum),"" the company said. Nord Imperial LLC and Alyansneftegaz LLC are subsidiaries of Imperial Energy Ltd., which in January of 2009 became part of OVL, which manages the foreign assets of ONGC. The Indian corporation also has a 20% stake in the Sakhalin-1 project. Nord Imperial holds prospecting and production licenses for three hydrocarbon sections - Festivalny, Snezhny, and Kyiv-Yegansky - and six licenses for the Maisky section, Yuzhno-Festivalny sections 1, 2, and 3, and Verkhne-Nyurolsky sections 1 and 2. Production is currently underway at the Festivalny, Kyiv-Yegansky, and Maisky sections. MOSCOW. Aug 6 (Interfax) - HRT Participacoes em Petroleo S.A., which is exploring 21 hydrocarbon blocks in Brazil's Solimoes Basin jointly with Russian TNK-BP, has abandoned licenses to two of the blocks, HRT said in a statement. HRT said it would not renew the concession agreement to the SOL-T-219 and SOL-T-220 blocks due to the difficulty in receiving the environmental and operating permits due to the national nature preserves located within the license territory. The term for the first stage of exploration expired on March 3, after which a halt in operations until August 3 was declared. HRT is now the operator for 19 blocks in the Solimoes Basin, which it is exploring jointly with TNK-Brasil. Rosneft acquired TNK-BP - along with its 45% stake in the concession agreement to the 21 exploration blocks - in March 2013. The project brings TNK-BP potential reserves amounting to 789 million barrels of oil equivalent, according to an audit by Degolyer&MacNaughton. Capital investment will total an estimated $9.2 billion, or about $14 billion including pipeline construction costs. TNK-BP and HRT initially expected Solimoes to be an oil project. However, because only gas has been detected so far, the partners are studying options for monetizing that resource. Prior to its acquisition by Rosneft, TNK-BP had said it would make a decision on monetizing the gas in the third quarter of 2013. MINSK. Aug 2 (Interfax) - Belarusian state-owned oil production association Belorusneft has signed an agreement with Ecuadorean and Chilean oil producers to create an alliance that will jointly explore and develop a block of oilfields in Ecuador, the Belarusian company told Interfax. ""A trilateral agreement was signed in Ecuador to create an alliance of companies to jointly explore and develop oil block 28 in the southwest of this Latin American country. State-run oil production companies Petroamazonas E.P. (Ecuador), Belorusneft and ENAP (Chile) joined the joint project,"" a Belorusneft spokesman said. In the negotiations preceding the signing, the heads of the Belarusian, Ecuadorian and Chilean companies ""identified a model and form of interaction and coordinated the basic legal, financial and production aspects of cooperation,"" the spokesman said. The parties also set out short-term tasks and harmonized the start of work by technical specialists to draft a geological survey plan. An international scientific practice forum was recently held on seismic survey and geological exploration at oilfields. It was organized with the help of Russian company Geoseis on the basis of Belorusneft. ""The forum's participants noted that Belorusneft possesses the technical, technological and HR potential that is in demand on the growing global market for these services. Experience in Russia, Venezuela and Ecuador confirms the effectiveness of the methods and equipment used. Belarusian technologies have proven a competitive commodity,"" the Belorusneft spokesman said, adding that the company does not rule out rendering seismic survey services in Bolivia, Peru and Colombia, as well. Ecuador provides for all of its own oil needs and exports up to 60% of the oil it produces. Established in 1966, Belorusneft specializes in the search, exploration and development of oil deposits, and it also produces oil and associated gas. In addition, it provides oil services outside of Belarus and offers tolling supplies of imported oil to Belarusian oil refineries. It sells the petroleum products it produces through its own chain of filling stations and trading organizations (the largest in Belarus), and it also exports. Last year the company produced 1.6 million tonnes of oil, compared to 1.6.8 million tonnes in 2011. ASTANA. August 5. (Interfax) - The Kazakh government might organize a National Service Company to become the prime contractor for the Future Growth Project (FGP) of Tengizchevroil (TCO), an informed source in the oil and gas industry told Interfax. ""The Kazakh government is looking into possibilities of supporting TCO's Future Growth Project. It may create a National Service Company which could become a prime contractor to the Future Growth Project and protect Kazakhstan's interests in the project through seeking an increase in the local content in TCO's procurement plans,"" he told the agency. As prime contractor to the project, the National Service Company could be actively involved in all FGP related activities, including design and engineering, placement of long-term orders for goods and services, placement of orders with Kazakh manufacturers, training of local personnel for the project and invitation of foreign partners, he said. Creating a National Service Company is the only way for Kazakhstan to benefit from the project, as most of the expenses associated with the project will stay in Kazakhstan, he said. ""Part of the shares of the new company could belong to either National Managing Holding Baiterek or National Company Kazakhstan-Engineering, the other shares could be owned by the Ministry of Industry,"" he said. TCO expects the investments in the Future Growth Project to total $23 billion, according to the source. ""I am sure that TCO will announce that the cost of the project needs to be raised to reach $30 billion,"" he said. ""TCO is hastening to seal a memorandum on FGP with the Kazakh government in early September this year on the terms and conditions that are the best for the company. The government, however, is preparing its own version of the memorandum, which will name the National Service Company as a key player in the project,"" he said. In late 2012 Baktykozha Izmukhambetov, governor of the Atyrau Region, and Krymbek Kusherbayev, who was vice minister at that time, slammed TCO for its low Kazakh content and low investments in social projects According to Izmukhambetov, local content only accounted for 4% in TCO's procurement, as the company preferred to contract foreign companies as service providers. KazMunayGas Deputy CEO Magzum Mirzagaliyev in mid-April said that KMG and TCO had been working towards increasing the local content in FGP up to 44%. ""The project that will be starting this year will create thousands of new jobs. TCO says local content in the project will be 32% or $7.3 billion. However, KMG is still negotiating this percentage with TCO, and is suggesting increasing it to 44%, or by an additional $2 billion worth of locally produced goods and services,"" he said. The Future Growth Project is the next major expansion of oil production at Tengiz. FGP will increase Tengizchevroil oil production by a further 12 million tonnes per year to a total of approximately 36 million tonnes per year. Future Growth Project builds upon the success of the recent Sour Gas Injection and Second Generation Plant expansion, which is proving the viability of sour gas injection into the Tengiz reservoir. Tengizchevroil develops the Tengiz and Korolyov oil and gas fields in the Atyrau Region (west Kazakhstan). The partnership Tengizchevroil was formed between the Republic of Kazakhstan and Chevron Corporation in April 1993. Current partners are: Chevron, 50 percent; KazMunaiGas, 20 percent; ExxonMobil, 25 percent and LukArco, 5 percent. The Tengiz field was discovered in 1979 and now is one of the world's deepest producing super giant fields. ALMATY. August 5. (Interfax) - Standard & Poor's Ratings Services raised its long-term corporate credit rating on Kazakhstan-based oil and gas exploration and production company Zhaikmunai L.P. to 'B+' from 'B'. The outlook is stable. S&P also raised the issue ratings on Zhaikmunai's senior secured notes to 'B+' from 'B'. The upgrade reflects S&P's assumption that Zhaikmunai will continue to achieve robust credit metrics in 2013-2014, including funds from operations (FFO) to debt of 40% or higher (2012: 48.6%) and debt to EBITDA below 2x in 2013-2014 (2012: 1.3x),, the rating agency said in a statement. ""This is based on our base-case scenario that the company will produce about 45,000 boepd (barrels of oil equivalent per day), which is close to full production capacity, and a realized price of no less than $95 per barrel in 2013 and $90 per barrel in 2014. We believe that adjusted EBITDA will be about $500 million in 2013 and between $400 million and $450 million in 2014. We also anticipate that oil prices will remain supportive,"" S&P says. The ""weak"" business risk assessment reflects S&P's view of the company's concentrated asset base, its dependence on one pipeline for crude oil and stabilized condensate and one pipeline for dry gas, as well as risks relating to the oil industry and operating in Kazakhstan. ""These are somewhat mitigated by good profitability, low cash lifting costs, a supportive tax regime, and the part-ownership of its local partner, Kazakhstan-based engineering company KazStroyService. Zhaikmunai acquired three new oil and gas fields in Kazakhstan in the third quarter of 2012, but these will not be producing before 2016,"" says the statement. Zhaikmunai is able to self-fund sizable capital expenditure (capex), which sets it apart from its peers, S&P reckons. Planned capex is at least $300 million in 2013 and $200 million in 2014, including spending on phase two of investment in the new gas treatment facility (GTF). This is likely to lead to neutral or slightly negative free operating cash flows in 2013-2014. S&P expects Zhaikmunai to adhere to its financial policies of maintaining debt to EBITDA at or below 1.5x and paying dividends of about 20% of net income. In November 2012, Zhaikmunai was able to reduce its interest burden, extend debt maturities, and diversify funding sources when it successfully issued $560 million of new senior notes. Key supporting factors for the rating are the company's good cash flow generation (unrestricted cash on balance sheet was $280 million on June 30, 2013) and its long-dated debt maturity profile. ""We understand that management aims to maintain a comfortable cash balance during the second GTF investment phase,"" the statement reads. The stable outlook on Zhaikmunai reflects S&P's expectation of robust credit metrics for the ratings on the back of near full capacity production in 2013 and 2014 of about 45,000 boepd. S&P anticipates that the company will adhere to its financial targets and the rating agency assumes neutral or slightly negative FOCF and continued adequate liquidity. ""All else being equal, we would consider raising the ratings if Zhaikmunai builds a track record of meeting its financial targets and we receive more information on the shareholders' investment strategy. In addition, greater cushion for liquidity could support the likelihood of an upgrade,"" the statement says. S&P says it could consider lowering the ratings if Zhaikmunai's production levels become considerably lower than S&P currently envisages or if they consider that the company's liquidity management or financial policies have become less prudent. Zhaikmunai is an independent oil and gas enterprise currently engaging in the exploration, production and sale of crude oil and gas condensate in northwestern Kazakhstan. Zhaikmunai's main producing asset is the Chinarevskoye field located in the northern part of the oil-rich Pre-Caspian Basin. The parent company of Zhaikmunai LLP is Zhaikmunai L.P., which held an IPO on London Stock Exchange in 2008. ASTANA. Aug 6 (Interfax) - An exploration well in the Zhambyl geological area, situated in the Kazakh sector of the Caspian Sea, has encountered hydrocarbons. ""An exploration well in the Zhambyl area has encountered hydrocarbons flowing at a rate of 60 tons per day. I am glad to announce that we have discovered a new oil field,"" Kazakh Oil and Gas Minister Uzakbai Karabalin told President Nursultan Nazarbayev. During their meeting, Karabalin briefed the president on the developments in such areas as oil and gas production, petrochemical industry and hydrocarbon transportation, the president's press office says in a Monday press release. They also discussed such large projects as Kashagan, Tengiz and Karachaganak, stressing that Kazakhstan's interests had to be protected, specifically, in the Tengiz project as well as in any other new projects, according to the press release. Nazarbayev commented on a good progress of the Kashagan project. The Oil Ministry should closely cooperate with international partners in order gain more knowledge and bring new technology, said the president. The minister informed the president about some oil statistics. ""In January-June 2013 the republic produced over 40 million tons of oil and gas condensate, which demonstrated a year-on-year increase of 1.8%. The output of natural and associated gas is on target. Exports of oil and gas products are generally on target, some minor fluctuations will be leveled out by the end of the year,"" the minister said. As reported, a drilling rig in the Zhambyl structure was built in summer 2012 by a Consortium of Korean investors which owns a 27% stake in this project. National Company KazMunaiGas holds a 73% stake and operates the project through its subsidiary KazMunaiTeniz. The Consortium is comprised of South Korean companies: Korean National Oil Corporation (KNOC, 35%), SK Corp. (25%), LG International Corp. (20%), Samsung Corp. (10%) and Daesung Industrial Co. Ltd (10%). The Zhambyl structure lies in the north of the Kazakh sector in the Caspian Sea, 50 km from the coastline and 180 km from the Aktau seaport. MOSCOW. Aug 6 (Interfax) - The Ireland-registered, Dubai-headquartered Dragon Oil, which produces hydrocarbons in Turkmenistan, saw its net profits drop 22% to $241.4 million in the first half of 2013, the company reported. Operating profits were down 20% at $324.1 million and sales revenues 16% at $491.6 million. The company attributes the revenue decrease to sales being down 2% and to a lower ($86/barrel) price for oil ($102/barrel a year earlier). Cost of product sold was $151.8 million in H1 this year versus $169.3 million in H1 last year. Daily production at Cheleken in Turkmenistan was up 15% year-on-year at 73,600 barrels in H1. Dragon Oil is developing this field under a production-sharing agreement. Its stake was 44% of total output versus 49% the year before. The company sold 5.7 million barrels of oil in H1 this year against 5.8 million barrels during the same period last year. All Its oil is exported through Baku. Dragon Oil cut its capex 28% to $149 million in H1. Around 37% of it went into the creation of infrastructure and exploratory drilling in Tunisia. ""A consortium of companies has been selected as the winning bidder for two exploration blocks, Sanduqli and Mazar-i-Sharif, in the Afghan-Tajik Phase-1 oil & gas tender. The consortium is currently in the final stages of negotiations with the Afghanistan Ministry of Mines and Petroleum for the exploration, development and production activities in these two blocks, which are expected to conclude in Q3 2013. The contract has been initialed and submitted for final approval of the authorities. The participating interest of Dragon Oil, Turkiye Petrolleri A.O. (TPAO) and the Ghazanfar Group in the two blocks is 40%, 40% and 20%, respectively. Dragon Oil shall be the operator of the Sanduqli block while the Mazar-i-Sharif block would be operated by TPAO. Dragon Oil's diversification strategy remains to screen and evaluate targets that fit our criteria within Africa, parts of Asia and the Middle East in order to create a diversified and balanced portfolio of exploration and development assets for the group,"" the company said. ""On the infrastructure front, installation of the Dzhygalybeg (Zhdanov) A platform is progressing well with drilling expected to commence from this platform in Q4 2013. We are currently reviewing options for an optimum location of the Dzhygalybeg (Zhdanov) B platform. Limited availability of quality contractors in the Caspian Sea region has held back our plans to add new platforms as quickly as intended; however, significant progress has been made this year to enable the group to award contracts in the near future for the construction of up to four platforms,"" Dragon Oil said. The controlling stock interest in Dragon Oil is held by Emirates National Oil Company, Ltd. Dragon Oil is working the contract territory of Cheleken in Turkmenistan's sector of the Caspian Sea under a production-sharing agreement signed with the Turkmen government in 1999.

"CONTENTS TOP STORIES Energy Ministry expecting oil production of 533 mln tonnes in 2015 MOSCOW. Oct 14 (Interfax) – The Russian Energy Ministry expects oil production will grow by more than 1% to 533 million tonnes in 2015 and by 1.3% again in 2016, Energy Minister Alexander Novak told reporters at a meeting of the management of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs (RUIE) on Wednesday. He said that despite external and domestic challenges, the Russian fuel and energy complex is coping with set tasks and the Ministry is hoping for the recovery of the balance of supply and demand for oil in the second half of 2016. He said that Urals crude will not necessarily fall in price when Iranian oil hits the market and announced an expert meeting would be held with OPEC next week. Novak also told reporters that tax discussions for the fuel and energy sector next year are now over and the export duty on oil will be kept at the level of 42% until September 1, 2016. The Russian budget will receive 133 billion rubles thanks to the decision and Novak said that the additional tax burden on oil companies, according to the estimates of the companies themselves, will lead to a fall in oil production in 2017 by about 1% of the current level or by 5 million-6 million tonnes. Production & exports Russian oil production will grow 1.3% to 532 million-533 million tonnes in 2015 and by 1.3% again in 2016, Energy Minister Alexander Novak told reporters. ""We are proceeding from the expected volume of production for 2015. This year we are expecting growth by about 1.3%, correspondingly, 532 million-533 million tonnes. And our companies are confirming that next year the same level may be reached,"" the minister said. ""But, based on the additional collections for the budget, there are risks for a reduction in production in 2017, because oil production is an inertial process, and not investing enough in 2016 will affect production in 2017. In general in the energy strategy we are focusing on the medium term at a level of 525 million tonnes. All of what is higher, this is an additional bonus received by the budget and companies,"" Novak said. Exports of Russian oil in 2015-2016 are forecast at the level of 237 million tonnes, Novak told journalists. ""Our figure for 2016 was 237 million tonnes. For this year it will be just as much,"" he said. Novak said that next year this amount will be reached due to additional production and the fall in the volumes of refining. Novak said that despite external and domestic challenges, the Russian fuel and energy complex is coping with set tasks and the Ministry is hoping for the recovery of the balance of supply and demand for oil in the second half of 2016. External challenges Urals crude will not necessarily fall in price when Iranian oil hits the market, Novak told reporters. ""There's no direct link. You shouldn't think in such direct terms,"" he said, when asked how much Urals crude might fall in price if Iranian oil hits the market. ""It won't necessarily fall in price. Everything will depend on what other countries produce, what demand there is. This all needs to be considered in the balance,"" he said. ""Each country has the right to work on any oil and gas market. We have the global oil market,"" Novak said, commenting on Saudi Arabia's entry onto new markets, including traditional markets for Russia. ""It has the right to sell where it feels is needed. This is competition. Now there is fierce competition on the oil market, taking into account the fact that the volume of production exceeds the volume of supply for now. Although there is already the tendency, during the last third quarter, demand was higher than production. And we are seeing the tendency for the reduction of production by 300,000 barrels a day. Therefore, we are hoping that we will feel the recovery of the balance, somewhere around the second half of 2016, we will have the balance of supply and demand,"" the minister said. Meanwhile, the Energy Ministry will meet with representatives of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in Vienna on October 21 at the level of experts, Novak said. ""On October 21, we will have a meeting at the level of exports. Representatives of the ministry will go to it,"" he said. Russia held a meeting with OPEC representatives, and also four-party consultations on the day before the latest cartel meeting at the start of June. In addition OPEC Secretary General Abdalla Salem el-Badri during a seminar on July 30 discussed the situation on the oil market and its possible development with the Russian delegation, which was headed by Novak. After the meeting, in a joint announcement, the parties said that the next meeting of the Russian delegation and OPEC may take place in Vienna in the second half of 2016. At its latest meeting in June OPEC decided to keep quotas at 30 million barrels a day. The next meeting of the ministers of OPEC members will take place on December 4 in Vienna. Downstream Novak also noted the very high rates of modernization of processing plants. ""We are undergoing [this stage of modernization] for three to five years, while Europe underwent this for 15 years,"" he said. The minister said that in 2015 Russia will reach full import substitution for polypropylene and in 2016-2017 for polyethylene. Novak said he intended to discuss a 40%-50% rise in polypropylene prices in Russia with the Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS). A State Duma deputy said at the RUIE meeting that polypropylene producers had hiked their prices 40%-50%, ""and simultaneously,"" adding that the enterprises that manufactured the end product could not raise their own prices for fear of becoming less competitive, and were having to lay off staff and buy products from abroad. Novak said in response that he planned to meet FAS chief Igor Artemyev this week and that he would ""make a note of the issue."" Novak said the state did not regulate prices for processing stage products. ""We have to examine the situation, the reason,"" he said, adding that there could be various reasons, like ""collusion, or objective growth resulting from producer price growth."" Russia's biggest polypropylene manufacturers are Tobolsk-Polymer, with capacity for 500,000 tonnes per year, the TAIF Group's Nizhnekamskneftekhim (220,000 tonnes), the Titan Group's Omsk-based Poliom (180,000 tonnes), SIBUR's Tomskneftekhim (140,000 tonnes), Lukoil's Stavrolen (120,000 tonnes), Ufaorgsintez, which is controlled by AFK Sistema's Unit Petrochemicals Company (100,000 tonnes); and NPP Neftekhimia, a joint venture between SIBUR and Gazprom Neft Sistema (100,000 tonnes). Asia-Pacific The Energy Ministry is studying, on the government's instructions, a project proposed by Lukoil to build a pipeline to transport Euro 5 standard diesel fuel to Asian-Pacific markets, Novak told reporters. ""Such an idea, really, was announced at a recent meeting with the prime minister on the development of oil refining in Kstovo on October 6. This idea was heard from Lukoil, on the construction of an oil product pipeline to the east. Currently we have the order to study all factors, opportunities and the feasibility of constructing such an oil product pipeline. We will work on this together with our companies, and we will study the issue in more detail,"" he said. ""There is no talk about volumes. This is all account positions, based on the needs of the market, based on the opportunities of our market for the supply of oil products to the east, taking into account the fact that we have most of our oil refineries, as it is known, located in the western part of the country. Therefore, here, of course, it is necessary to very seriously calculate the economics of a project, the opportunities and resources. For now this is just an idea,"" the minister said. ""The project is only being studied, there's no route yet,"" he said. In its updated energy strategy to 2035, the Energy Ministry said one risk to the industry is ""saturation of the diesel fuel market in Europe and declining demand in the near abroad."" The minister said that Russia will increase exports of oil and petroleum products, including to the countries of the Asia-Pacific region and to the European market, in connection with the fall in refining volumes thanks to the increase in the depth of processing. He said that in the framework of the Energy Strategy the reconstruction and use of oil pipeline capacities was envisaged, in particular, the reconstruction and transition of oil pipelines into petroleum product pipelines to the west. ""That is, we are evaluating all markets: both western and eastern, from the point of view of supplies of Russian petroleum products,"" Novak said. Earlier sources told Interfax that at a government meeting on oil refining at the start of October in Nizhny Novgorod, Lukoil head Vagit Alekperov proposed construction of an oil product pipeline parallel to Eastern Siberia-Pacific Ocean (ESPO) oil pipeline to export diesel fuel to markets in the Asia-Pacific region. The proposal is connected to fears that Russia may face a serious Euro 5 diesel fuel overproduction situation in the next few years. Oil companies worry that leading automotive manufacturers are switching to more ecological gasoline engines, after Russia spent years intensively modernizing refineries and ramping up production of Euro 5 diesel fuel. It was expected that Euro 5 would be exported to Europe on the upgraded Sever oil product pipeline. In addition, Russia began construction of the Yug oil product pipeline to export Euro 5 diesel fuel to Southern Europe. Gazprom Neft chief Alexander Dyukov, who took part in the meeting, said Alekperov's proposal was interesting but difficult to implement. ""This is not realistic,"" he told Interfax. ""In order to recoup investment, the capacity would need to be over 50 million tonnes a year. We don't have those volumes. The project can probably be further worked up, but intuition tells me that it is unlikely to be realized, unfortunately,"" Dyukov said. ""For us this would be an additional route for transporting diesel fuel, this is diversification, flexibility. For us this is necessary, important. The question is - who pays? Transneft is not ready to. If they are going to invest, they need to be able to recoup investment. Are they ready to build a pipeline with 10 million tonnes of capacity that will never break even? Or maybe they will charge tariffs that will make in uninteresting for us,"" he said. Elsewhere, plans exist to expand the capacity of the port of Kozmino, via which oil shipped along ESPO is exported, to 31.5 million tonnes from a current 30 million tonnes of oil per year, Novak said. In time, capacity could be increased to 35 million tonnes per year, he said. Tax & duties Tax discussions for the fuel and energy sector next year are now over, Novak told reporters. ""Tax discussions for next year are over, at least at government level. Final decisions were reached at Thursday's Cabinet meeting,"" Novak said. But he recalled that no decisions had yet been reached on gasoline excise taxes. He said there might be a differential of up to 3,500 rubles between standard 4 and 5 gasoline. ""This will probably come about due to raising the excise tax on Euro 4. It will have no bearing on the end price as standard 5 is effectively the price-forming gasoline today. Next year, this will make up around 90% [of all gasoline produced in Russia],"" he said. ""The decision will be reached now in the State Duma, when the tax package is debated,"" he said. Meanwhile, the export duty on oil will be kept at the level of 42% until September 1, 2016, Novak said. He said that the changes in the taxation of the sector may lead to a fall in Russian oil production by 5 million-6 million tonnes in 2017. The Energy Ministry and the Economic Development Ministry are both against an extension of the freeze of the export duty on oil after September 1, 2016, although the Finance Ministry supports it for the whole calendar year. ""Whether or not the freeze will be extended, this is not a question for me. We are against an extension and feel that all decisions need to be made in accordance with the tax maneuver. Today's decision was made for one year and we are hoping that this decision will be restrained,"" he said. Business daily Vedomosti reported Deputy Energy Minister Kirill Molodtsov as saying that the duty should be lowered to 36% in September 2016, as prescribed by the tax maneuver in the oil industry. Keeping the duty unchanged until September will generate about 150 billion rubles in revenue for the government, and the budget will get another 50 billion rubles thanks to growth of oil production and, consequently, the tax base. The head of tax and customs tariff policy at the Finance Ministry, Ilya Trunin confirmed that the government has drafted a resolution to freeze the export duty only until the end of August, the paper said. The decision on the duty rate after August will be made next summer following an analysis of the situation with government budget revenues and the situation in the industry. The Energy Ministry also had other proposals, such as to lower the export duty to 38-39% while raising excise rates on diesel fuel, but this idea was abandoned. It was reported earlier that the Finance Ministry was proposing to keep the export duty on oil at the 2015 level of 42% in 2016 instead of lowering it to 36% as previously planned. This would generate about 200 billion rubles in extra budget revenues. The proposal has been harshly criticized by oil companies, which have warned of a possible drop in oil production in Russia as a result of such a decision, as well as by the Energy Ministry, which wants to stabilize the tax system in the industry for the next five years. The Russian budget will receive 133 billion rubles thanks to a decision to keep the export duty on oil at 42% until September 1, 2016, Novak said. ""Literally last week, on Thursday, the government decided to keep oil export duty in the framework of a major tax maneuver at 42% until September 1, 2016, while [previously] the duty was to have been lowered to 36% on January 1, 2016. This additional burden will yield some 133 billion rubles in extra levies,"" Novak said. Oil cos skeptical Russia's oil companies doubt that the increased taxation approved by the government will only be in effect in 2016, Novak said, adding that the Finance Ministry needs to think about tax stability. ""In my view, we have a clear contradiction. On one hand, we say that long-term rules of the game are needed, and on the other, that we change these rules every year,"" Novak said. This reduces the opportunities for investment and makes the business climate worse. ""The Finance Ministry is probably saying that beginning next year we won't do anything. But the companies are skeptical and that means that they won't make any investment decisions,"" Novak said, adding that since many of the oil and gas companies are public, they make decisions based on various factors, notably, tax stability. Novak urged the Finance Ministry to think 10 years ahead. The tax hikes also mean that the state is taxing the market sector and deciding for itself how to spend the money, which is at odds with Russia's transition to a market economy. ""At every turn, it is said that the state invests resources inefficiently,"" Novak said, citing in particular reports from the Audit Chamber. ""But the decision has been made. We are not discussing it. We are carrying out these tasks, but continue to work on efficiency [in the fuel and energy sector],"" he said, adding: ""The idea of stability in the tax system must be promoted and fundamental principles that were approved when the tax maneuver was enacted must be fought for."" Gas The mineral extraction tax (MET) on gas in 2016 will amount to 100 billion rubles. MET on gas will be raised for all of 2016, a representative of the Energy Ministry told Interfax. ""The duty on oil is frozen until the end of August, but the MET on gas is being raised for all of 2016,"" he said. He said 100 billion rubles would be taken in MET for gas in 2016. He said that the Finance Ministry is insisting upon the need to receive an additional 200 billion rubles from the oil sector for the budget. The proposal on the freeze of the duty at 42% is a compromise. This will allow for the direct receipt of additional revenue of 133 billion rubles due to the duty. ""The remaining funds will be received from the specification of the forecast regarding oil production: from the increase of the duty to the additional volumes and from the MET for additional volumes,"" the minister said. ""This will mean the investment programs of oil and gas companies will have to be altered. The tax decision applies to Gazprom, where raising MET is concerned. The volume of investment will decrease by these very figures,"" Novak said. ""This, the companies themselves estimate, could result in a change in the volume of oil produced in 2017. Not in 2016, as the sector will take time to respond, but in 2017, by around 1% of our oil production volume, that's around 5 million-6 million tonnes,"" Novak said. The minister said that gas production this year will be ""somewhat higher"" that it was in 2014. Last year Russia produced 640 billion cubic meters (bcm) of gas, which is 30 bcm less than in 2013. The Energy Ministry's forecast for gas production this year is 668 bcm, which is 4.3% more than the figure for last year. Meanwhile, the Ministry is not expecting Ukraine to import gas in reverse mode this autumn and winter, Novak told reporters, commenting on the recent resumption by Naftogaz Ukrainy of gas purchases from Russia's Gazprom. ""Of course we're interested in direct gas supplies. The first advance payment has already been received, Russian gas went to Ukraine from Monday. In our view, this is positive as it means that to some extent, gas supply volumes can be restored ahead of the autumn-winter period. The main thing is that Naftogaz is able to find the resources to pay for gas supplies during the winter period. And apart from Russia and Gazprom Ukraine's needs for gas are unlikely to be met in the winter period, and I can even say for sure that they won't be met from reverse supplies,"" Novak said. ""We think it's Ukraine's prerogative, where they get their gas from. Unfortunately, little consideration is given to economics when they decide where they get their gas. Throughout the third quarter, Ukraine bought gas for $30 more than Russian gas was being offered. In our view that is not right, because for the same money they could have bought more gas and pumped it into their underground storage facilities. As for reverse supplies from Poland, Hungary and Slovakia, then as you know, two-thirds of this comes from Russian gas that has been supplied to Europe,"" Novak said. MOSCOW. Oct 13 (Interfax) - Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov and Russian Economic Development Minister Alexei Ulyukayev disagree about the need for state support for the country's oil sector. Speaking at the at the Russia Calling! forum, organized by VTB Capital, in Moscow on Tuesday, Ulyukayev said the fuel and energy complex needs help as the principal contributor to the federal budget, while Siluanov countered that the sector is negotiating current global difficulties well and said concessions and preferences from the state should be received primarily by non-oil sectors of the economy. Ulyakayev meanwhile said that the forecast for Russian oil production in 2016 has been raised to 533 million tonnes from 528 million tonnes, and the forecast for oil exports has been increased by 7 million tonnes. He said this was the result of a reduction in planned collections from the oil sector from 600 billion to 200 billion rubles. Rosneft President Igor Sechin meanwhile warned at the Forum that oil production in Russia will fall by 25 million-30 million tonnes per year in the next three years if the tax burden on the fuel and energy sector continues to grow. Turning to regulatory issues, Ulyukayev said that tariffs in Russia should be set based on the principle of ""inflation minus,"" and gas prices for industry in Russia should not exceed 70% of European prices. Need for support At the Forum, Siluanov and Ulyukayev argued over whether the oil sector needs state support, with the finance minister saying that the oil sector feels itself to be quite alright in the crisis, while the economic development minister said he believes that the fuel and energy complex should receive support given its position as the main donor to the budget. ""Who is the main producer of value in our country? The oil sector. What needs to be done? It is necessary to help the oil business invest,"" Ulyukayev said. Concessions and preferences from the state should be received primarily by non-oil sectors of the economy, Siluanov said. ""In our view, if one is to speak about some preferences, this should be processing, this should be industry, but we need to worry less about the oil sector, because the oil sector feels itself to be alright in crisis conditions,"" Siluanov said. He said that in recent times the state has mainly helped the oil sector. ""It turns out that this volume of state resources that we have, it is concentrated there, because prices were high, the concessions, if one looks, which we gave recently, were mainly to the oil business, ""the most downtrodden"", in quotation marks, of course. Therefore, so that we develop the oil sector, the more we give concessions, the more we help oil workers, the less that remains for other sectors of the economy,"" the minister said. He called such a concentration of state aid in one sector ""the tactical mistake"" of the last few years. ""Conversely, more resources are necessary to keep for other sectors. Not to develop the oil sector, not to topple into the Dutch Disease, not to become solely dependent on the oil sector, on the country's gas. This is absolutely the incorrect approach,"" Siluanov said. Ulyukayev said that the oil sector needs help to invest in mature fields. ""There is not a large tax return there and there is not the largest demand for associated equipment. We have on the shelf a very large amount of imported equipment, and for mature fields, 100% [of equipment] was produced in Russia. With the Energy Ministry, we reviewed the forecast for oil production at plus 5 million tonnes, and for export - plus 7 million tonnes. This is a good source of funds for the budget, and most importantly, a good basis for investment development,"" the minister said. ""Second of all, it is necessary to help them made the step to the next production area - to go into processing, to develop petrochemicals, gas chemistry. For this, it is necessary to share the risks. We have already a very good example in Western Siberia - we are developing there, with the Russian Direct Investment Fund, and part of the risks were taken on by the state in the form of its institute, part of the risks are being borne by the National Welfare Fund. We are actually enabling the diversification of the use of resources not on crude, but to high degree on processing, on large added value,"" Ulyukayev said. Production, not pressure Russia does not intend to put pressure on the oil industry by imposing additional taxes on it, Russian President Vladimir Putin said at the Forum. ""I want to reassure you: we perfectly understand how important the oil and gas sector is. And in driving towards structural changes, we will not do this due to pressure on a sector, which is working effectively,"" he said. He said that initially the Finance Ministry proposed collecting 600 billion rubles from the oil industry, now the sum of 200 billion rubles is being discussed. The forecast for Russian oil production in 2016 has been raised to 533 million tonnes from 528 million tonnes, and the forecast for oil exports has been increased by 7 million tonnes, Ulyukayev said. ""We have revised the forecast for oil production for next year up by 5 [million tonnes], from 528 [million tonnes] to 533 million tonnes, and for exports by 7 million tonnes, and it seems to me that there is still a reserve here,"" he said. The increase in the forecast is connected with the reduction of planned collections from the oil sector from 600 billion to 200 billion rubles, he said. ""Initially there was the plan through the adjustment of the mineral extraction tax (MET) to collect 600 billion rubles from the oil sector, and then it was limited to only 200 billion rubles. Accordingly, the deduction from investments is turning out to be less, and this approximately corresponds to 5 million tonnes of produced oil,"" he said. Sechin meanwhile warned at the Forum that oil production in Russia will fall by 25 million-30 million tonnes per year in the next three years if the tax burden on the fuel and energy sector continues to grow. ""The situation with investment programs in the industry is worsening after the decision to keep the export duty on oil at the current level. If this trend continues, in the next three years we will experience the risks of oil production falling by 25 million-30 million tonnes annually, which will produce a negative fiscal effect,"" Sechin said. ""The oil industry had a negative cash flow in the first half of the year, and we need to understand that there is current stability of production. But I would like to point out that the results were obtained as a result of investment in past years, therefore we need to support, not remove resources from current investment programs,"" Sechin said, remarking that Rosneft is in favour of a stable tax system and support for investment. Despite this, production costs of Russian oil companies are the lowest in the world, Sechin said. ""Our costs are the lowest in the world, in the whole industry. The cost of extracting oil is about $4 per barrel at Gazprom Neft, $4.50 at Lukoil. At Rosneft it is $2.80 per barrel. This is the best figure in the world,"" he said. Sechin said he is insisting upon the need to keep investments in the oil and gas sector at the level of previous years. ""There is currently stability of production. But these results were received, as we say, as a result of investments of previous years. It is necessary to keep investments at the level of previous years,"" he said. Rosneft itself has all the necessary financial resources to settle for on loans and investment, he said. ""Roseneft's financial situation is stable. The company has enough reserves of liquidity to settle for loans and investment,"" he said. He also argued that regulation of the world oil market has essentially passed from OPEC to the United States. ""Regulation, which was earlier carried out by OPEC, has essentially begun to form on the regional market of the U.S., which has turned into a regulator of global scale,"" Sechin said. He said that this was not only due to the shale oil phenomenon, but a ""whole set of factors,"" including financial sources, financial derivatives, exchanges, a developed pipeline system and developed system of contractors. The development of the oil market will also be determined by how contracts for shale production will be hedged, Sechin said. Tariffs growth Turning to regulatory issues, Ulyukayev said that tariffs in Russia should be set based on the principle of ""inflation minus,"" and gas prices for industry in Russia should not exceed 70% of European prices. ""We need to maintain the right correlation between businesses' costs and their revenues. A reasonable tariff policy, including two principles, is needed for this. The first principle is 'inflation minus' [or indexation of tariffs more slowly than inflation in the previous period] with a view to the Bank of Russia's target or the forecast figure rather than actual inflation. The second principle is maintaining a gap in resource prices between the Russian consumer and the average European consumer. We believe that this gap should be about 30% for gas. In other words, the price for the Russian producer should not exceed 70% of the price for the average European producer,"" Ulyukayev said. A final decision on tariffs will be made slightly later, most likely, within a month's time, although the proposals will be included in the forecast, he said. ""No [a final decision was not made]. The final decision, as a regulator decision, will be later, but was made for the purposes of making a forecast,"" the minister said. Answering a follow-up question, when the final decision would be, Ulyukayev said: ""Usually in a month's time, a final regulator decision is made."" He said that the Economic Development Ministry kept its proposals for tariffs in its forecast. It was reported that the Economic Development Ministry in its socioeconomic forecast set the indexation of tariffs for gas in 2016 from July 1 at 2%, tariffs on railway freight from January 1 are to be indexed by 10%, tariffs on passenger railway transport from January 1 by 4%, grids tariffs from July 1 by 7.5%. the indexation of tariffs for the population from July 1 is proposed to be carried out according to the following principle: the growth of total tariffs for housing and utilities should not exceed 4%. The Ministry is keeping proposals for the increase in tariffs for power grids in 2016 at 7.5%, Deputy Economic Development Minister Nikolai Podguzov told journalists on the sidelines of the Forum. Podguzov said that the final decisions on all tariff adjustments for next year will be made in the next few days. No serious changes regarding their proposals are expected at the ministry. The tariffs of natural monopolies should be based on the cost of transporting oil and gas, not the prices of these commodities on global markets, Sechin said. ""The growth of natural monopoly tariffs should primarily reflect growth of expenses needed to increase the accessibility of services. We are facing a situation where natural monopolies proceed not from the cost of pumping or transporting our commodities, but from their market prices. Or, for example, where we are forced to pay for the services of natural monopolies in foreign currency on Russian territory. Where is the depreciation effect here?"" Sechin said. Central Bank of Russia (CBR) chief Elvira Nabiullina told the Forum she believes tariffs of natural monopolies should not increase by more than the rate of inflation. ""If the tariffs of natural monopolies grow faster than inflation, this means that other sectors receive less revenue. It seems to me that this distorts economic growth, despite the fact that we can achieve inflation targets. Therefore, we support the policy of that part of the government that is in favor of having tariffs of natural monopolies grow more slowly than inflation,"" Nabiullina said. She said that if prices grow faster than inflation in a given sector, the CBR can achieve the same inflation targets with tighter monetary policy, but prices in other sectors will grow more slowly than inflation and might even see deflation. Essentially, other sectors will lose profitability. The tariffs of natural monopolies should be indexed more slowly than the rate of inflation, considering that for many years they have risen more rapidly than inflation and there is an accumulated reserve of this growth, Nabiullina said. In addition, natural monopolies have internal reserves to increase efficiency that should be used first of all, rather than shifting costs to other sectors, Nabiullina said. Dividend requirements Elsewhere at the Forum, Russian Federal Property Agency (Rosimuschestvo) head Olga Dergumova said the Agency is against lowering the 25% dividend requirement for state companies, despite the tax maneuver. ""We think this must not be done. Our position: stable dividends, this is essentially the making of a successful investment climate."" No specific discussions on adjusting the dividend policies of state oil and gas companies are currently in progress, but such a step is hypothetically possible, First Deputy Russian Energy Minister Alexei Teksler told reporters earlier. He said his ministry has received proposals from oil and gas companies and is now studying them and will put them up for discussion at the presidential commission for the fuel and energy sector. ""The discussion at the level of the government has not finished yet,"" Teksler said. One such measure is the accelerated introduction of a tax on financial result, but there are various proposals, he said. At the beginning of October, business daily Vedomosti reported that state oil and gas companies are asking to reduce their dividend payments as compensation for the government co",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Crimea leaders say will convene military tribunal for Poroshenko for pledge to regain control over Crimea SIMFEROPOL. Feb 23 (Interfax) - The Crimean leader, Sergei Aksyonov, said after Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko pledged to bring Crimea back under Ukraine's control after its reintegration with Russia in March 2014, that a military tribunal will be convened to try Poroshenko. ""We pledged to convene a military tribunal in Crimea for Poroshenko and, believe us, we will deliver on our pledge. We will bring him here and try him,"" Aksyonov told reporters in Simferopol on Monday. Poroshenko earlier released a statement on the occasion of the anniversary since Crimea rejoined Russia, saying that Ukraine will regain control over Crimea and threatening to prosecute the organizers and participants in the change of Crimea's territorial status. The statement was posted on the Ukrainian president's website on Monday.

"Crimean authorities plan prompt nationalization of Ukrainian state companies SIMFEROPOL. March 12 (Interfax) - The Crimean authorities will nationalize the property of Ukrainian state companies on the territory of the republic in the next few days, and the nationalization will not affect private companies, Crimean First Deputy Prime Minister Rustam Temirgaliyev told Interfax. ""The property of state companies, including resource-extracting companies such as Chernomorneftegaz, and other state companies such as Ukrzaliznitsya and some state-run health resorts will become property of the Republic of Crimea in the near future,"" Temirgaliyev said. ""Ukrainian private companies will have no problem, they will work as they did if they are legally registered and operate on the territory of Crimea, if they have the right of property to the enterprises they operate,"" Temirgaliyev said. ""Russian banks are already coming to Crimea. Several heads of Russian banks already plan to open their offices there. After Crimea joins Russia, Ukrainian banks can register here as foreign banks,"" he said.

"Сrash site of the Malaysian Boeing 777 EDINBURGH, July 21 (RIA Novosti) - European investigators, who unexpectedly arrived on the Malaysian aircraft crash site in eastern Ukraine, had no legal locus to participate in the investigation without Kiev's invite, Professor Robert Black of the University of Edinburgh, known as the architect of the Lockerbie trial, told RIA Novosti on Monday. If the nation decides that they dont have the necessary facilities or investigative infrastructure, then they can call on another state or states to lend them the expertise, said Black, a globally recognized legal expert, who specialized in examining the judicial issues surrounding the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie. Air investigation teams from Europe simply arrived at the scene and are now complaining that they werent immediately allowed free access to the site, the lawyer said. It is understandable that they should be annoyed, but they have no legal locus to be there whatsoever unless and until they are invited to participate by the state which has the legal responsibility to investigate, Black added. The law is that the responsibility to investigate is that of the state where the plane came down. But given the circumstances in that part of Ukraine at the moment, it is a difficult question to answer. Who is the state and who is the government of that state? the expert said. Black agreed it was important for the site to be secured and called for proper international investigation into the circumstances of the crash. Malaysia Airlines' Flight MH17 en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur crashed on July 17 near Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, causing death of 283 passengers and 15 crew members. Ukrainian government and militia have been trading blame for the alleged downing of the plane, with independence supporters saying they lacked the technology to shoot down a target flying at altitude of 10 kilometers (6.2 miles). Commenting on the crash, Russian President Vladimir Putin said it was vital to abstain from hasty conclusions on the case before the international investigation was over. The UN Security Council late on Sunday night completed the text of its resolution regarding the Malaysia Airlines crash. Russia introduced its own draft resolution to the UN Security Council, calling for an impartial investigation into the circumstances of the crash.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Dacic: OSCE doing all it can to solve crisis in Ukraine BUDVA, June 6 (Tanjug) - OSCE Chairperson and Serbian Minister of Foreign Affairs Ivica Dacic stated on Saturday that all OSCE instruments have been launched in the search for a solution to the crisis in Ukraine. At the same time, this serves as support to key steps Ukraine needs to take, including constitutional reforms, protection of national minority rights, national dialogue and reconciliation, Dacic said at the forum entitled 'Future perspectives of a global security architecture' in Budva. The package of measures announced in Minsk on February 12 constitutes the best road sign for recovery of peace in eastern Ukraine, he said. We have managed to set up four working groups in charge of key issues including stability, political process, humanitarian issues, economic issues and recovery. The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine is doing all it can to facilitate the reconciliation and withdrawal of heavy weapons, Dacic said and noted that OSCE observers are working in a dangerous and instable situation.

"Deputies of the Moscow city duma have issued a statement saying that any foreign interference in Ukraine's internal affairs is inadmissible, Russian state news agency RIA Novosti reported on 26 February. ""We are alarmed by instances of physical violence against representatives of state authority bodies, political parties and law-enforcement officers, which have become more frequent, as well as arson and violence [Rus: pogromy],"" RIA Novosti quoted Moscow city duma deputy speaker Andrey Metelskiy as saying. According to Metelskiy, Moscow city duma deputies hope that Ukraine's political leaders will do all they can to prevent another uprising and preserve Ukraine's territorial integrity. ""As a brotherly state goes through a difficult period, we are ready to provide the necessary help and support. At the same time, the Moscow city duma considers any foreign interference in the internal affairs of sovereign Ukraine inadmissible,"" Metelskiy said. All 30 deputies voted in favor of the statement, the report said. Moscow's previous mayor, Yuriy Luzhkov, frequently advocated maintaining the Russian navy's presence in the Ukrainian republic of Crimea, and in 1999 he suggested building a bridge across the Kerch Strait to link Crimea to Russia's Krasnodar Region. In 2008 Ukraine temporarily declared him persona non grata after he said the port of Sevastopol should never have been handed over to Ukraine along with the rest of Crimea in 1954.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Director of the Moscow Bureau for Human Rights Alexander Brod MOSCOW, April 23 (RIA Novosti) - Russian human rights campaigners forecast a rise of xenophobia and anti-Semitic attitudes among Ukrainians amid the local governments failure to resolve the crisis, the head of the Moscow Human Rights Bureau Alexander Brod said Wednesday. Brod, who is also a member of the Presidential Council for the Development of Civic Society and Human Rights, said the Moscow Human Rights Bureau has unveiled a report focusing on new negative trends in modern Ukrainian society. The report marks growing anti-Semitic attitudes both in the Ukrainian capital, Kiev, as well as in western Ukraine and the countrys eastern regions, where protesters have been campaigning in support of federalization since March. This is the desecration of synagogues and monuments related to Holocaust, attacks on Hasidic Jews and members of the Jewish community, Brod told a RIA Novosti video link-up between Moscow and Tel Aviv. The Jewish-Russian human rights activist said in most cases these crimes have been slurred over and used by protest groups and authorities in Ukraine to mobilize people and unite such radical groups. With the lack of sound forces capable of uniting the interests of people in western and eastern Ukraine, anti-Semitism and neo-Nazi incidents will continue in the country, Brod said. The activist criticized the United Nations, Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the Council of Europe for failing to voice concerns over the rise of such attitudes in the country. The Ukrainian regime is absolutely encouraged by Western and US structures calling this an export of democracy, Brod said, urging Russia to find allies in Israel which cannot stay indifferent towards the rise of the neo-Nazi attitudes. We should tell the truth about what is going on in modern Ukraine, he said. In February, the Ukrainian parliament backed by far-right movements ousted President Viktor Yanukovych and scheduled an early presidential election for May 25. Moscow has described the uprising in Kiev as an illegitimate fascist coup and a military seizure of power, which resulted in it taking steps to protect ethnic Russians in Ukraine, including the reunification with Crimea.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"DONETSK (Rostov Region), August 20 (RIA Novosti) – A convoy carrying Russian humanitarian aid to southeastern Ukraine remains at the border checkpoint with the representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) giving instructions to the drivers, a representative of the contractor carrier company transporting the cargo told RIA Novosti on Wednesday. ""The Red Cross is dealing with the issues of security, the representatives of the organization are meeting with the drivers and instructing them,"" he said. The representative did not say when the trucks would start moving toward Ukraine. The first 16 trucks are at the Russian Donetsk checkpoint while the rest of the 280-truck convoy remains near the town of Kamensk-Shakhtinsky. Earlier reports suggested the pause might be due to the fact that the Red Cross had not received security guarantees for the convoy to safely drive through the conflict-torn Ukrainian regions to deliver the cargo. In early August, amid the worsening humanitarian situation in Ukraine, Russia proposed to send an international humanitarian mission to eastern Ukraine with Russian aid under the auspices of the ICRC. A convoy carrying about 2,000 tons of humanitarian aid including baby food, medication, grain, sugar and other basic necessities set off from the Moscow Region on August 12 heading towards Ukraine's conflict areas.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Donetsk on the eve of elections MOSCOW (Sputnik) — German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande agreed on Saturday that separate elections in Ukraine's breakaway Donetsk and Lugansk regions would undermine the Minsk peace agreement, the German government said.

In the early hours of Tuesday, militiamen, in the number of up to one reinforced company, arrived on armored vehicles at Kominternove situated in the 'grey zone' near Mariupol and entered the village, according to the report. Apart from small arms and grenade launchers, the enemy was equipped with combat armored vehicles, probably even tanks and other heavy weaponry, use of which is prohibited by the Minsk agreements, the press center said. The information on the alleged gross violation on the part of DPR militia forces of the preliminary agreements on the peaceful settlement of the Donbas conflict was promptly distributed by the Joint Centre for Control and Coordination to representatives of the Special Monitoring Mission of the OSCE, it said. In addition, the press center said that according to the most recent data, the enemy is stepping up its presence near the demarcation line in the Mariupol area, using the weapons banned from use by the Minsk agreements.

"DONETSK. Oct 1 (Interfax) - The leader of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic (DPR), Alexander Zakharchenko, has accused the Ukrainian side of violating the agreement on the withdrawal of weapons in Donbas and has announced that the militia will suspend this process. ""In accordance with the Minsk agreements, it [weapons withdrawal] was supposed to take place even earlier. Yesterday I signed a decree on the withdrawal of weapons, but I strongly doubt that it will be implemented because the rhetoric of the Ukrainian military differs sharply from the rhetoric of [Kyiv's] representatives in Minsk. [The weapons withdrawal agreement] was signed yesterday, but Donetsk was shelled this morning,"" Zakharchenko told reporters on Thursday. ""The document makes it absolutely clear that [weapons will start to be withdrawn] the next day since the moment when fire is ceased. Fire was not ceased today and [weapons] withdrawal has been postponed,"" he said. If the Ukrainian side commits any violations, the DPR will be ready to bring hardware back, Zakharchenko said.

April 8 (Interfax) - Ukraine does not recognize birth and death certificates issued on the territory of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) on Ukrainian forms and does not pay child benefits, Yana Chepikova, DPR adviser on children's rights, said. ""Ukraine currently does not want to recognize the birth and deaths of these children. Ukraine doesn't recognize these documents. The question is why?"" Chepikova told a press conference on Wednesday. Chepikova said people who are born on the territory of the DPR are issued ""standard birth certificates on Ukrainian forms with Ukrainian stamps,"" but their parents cannot get any child benefits. She also said Ukraine has not made any payments to families with children and children with disabilities since October 2014. ""The payment of all social benefits, from newborn benefits to benefits to families with children and benefits to children with disabilities, stopped in October,"" Chepikova said. Chepikova said people who want to travel from Donbas to Ukraine with their children are also having problems. ""Our children cannot enter territories controlled by Ukraine.

"DPR-LPR statement on unilateral arms withdrawal aims to raise Contact Group efficiency - Pushilin (Part 2) MOSCOW. July 18 (Interfax) - The joint statement by authorities of the self-proclaimed Donbas republics on the unilateral withdrawal of armaments with caliber under 100mm is a step made on the eve of a Contact Group meeting scheduled for July 21, DPR representative Denis Pushilin has said. ""That will probably be discussed on [July] 21 because preliminary debates not supported with concrete actions unfortunately do not lead to anything. Ukraine finds different variants, so to say, to pick on particular words, particular issues, in order not to fulfill, not to do anything,"" he said in a program aired by the television channel Rossiya 24. ""We are taking a unilateral step, which is rather resolute and daring, and this is a concrete action. That is, Ukraine will have nowhere, so to say, to wander off, but will either have to accept and do the same or admit that they are, probably, supporting a military solution to this conflict,"" Pushilin said. He noted that the initiative put forward by the DPR and the LPR demonstrated their ""adherence to the peaceful way of resolution of this conflict."" ""Once again and in a unilateral manner we are taking a number of steps in order to initiate or accelerate the fulfillment process regarding provisions of the Package of Measures which have been coordinated, have been guaranteed by the chiefs of state, and which must be urgently implemented,"" Pushilin said. He emphasized that the militia was expecting reciprocal peace-loving steps from Kyiv. ""A step forward like that. If we live to see the same actions taken by Ukraine, if there are really people there who are ready to make concrete decisions rather than simply declare them from [TV] screens addressing the European and international public, then we will be really able to take some efficient steps in the field of full-fledged termination of the hostilities and securing of truce,"" the DPR negotiator said. He noted that the declared withdrawal of armaments will start after they receive a positive signal from the Ukrainian authorities. ""It is now necessary to receive a response.

"Drives during a stopover. A convoy of 280 Kamaz trucks carrying humanitarian aid to civilians in southeastern Ukraine moves on MOSCOW, August 21 (RIA Novosti) - The Russian Foreign Ministry on Thursday called on all parties concerned to prevent any disruptions in the delivery of Russian humanitarian cargo to eastern Ukraine. The most important task for now is to ensure that the convoy reaches its destination point without any disruptions, the ministry said in a statement. The Russian side reiterates its firm security guarantees. Similar guarantees have also been provided by the Ukrainian authorities and the militia. The ministry also warned of possible provocations aimed at disrupting the delivery of aid. Ukraines National Security Council spokesman Andriy Lysenko said earlier today that Kiev had no information on when the Russian humanitarian aid convoy can enter the country. On Thursday afternoon, Ukrainian customs officials confirmed that they had started inspecting the first trucks carrying Russian humanitarian aid to eastern Ukraine. Earlier in August, in light of the worsening humanitarian situation in Ukraine, Russia suggested sending an international humanitarian mission to eastern Ukraine under the auspices of the ICRC. The convoy comprises 280 trucks carrying about 2,000 tons of humanitarian aid, including baby food, medicine, grain, sugar, sleeping bags and other necessities. It set off from the Moscow Region on August 12 heading toward Ukraines conflict areas. However, the convoy has been stuck on Russias border with Ukraine and Kiev had been sending conflicting reports on whether the cargo would be allowed to proceed into eastern Ukraine. After lengthy negotiations Kiev finally recognized the cargo as humanitarian aid.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dec 16 (Interfax) - International events, the current economic situation in Russia, the Ukrainian crisis and sanctions are expected to dominate the agenda for Russian President Vladimir Putin's annual press conference on December 18, presidential press secretary Dmitry Peskov believes. ""It is easy to predict that certainly there will be a whole number of questions concerning the international situation and a whole range of questions linked with the events in Ukraine because it is the final press conference,"" Peskov told Interfax. ""Obviously, much time will be dedicated to the economy one way or the other,"" the press secretary said. The conflict in eastern Ukraine will also be addressed, Peskov said. ""As a result of those tragic events that occurred in Ukraine last winter, there will naturally be questions about the situation in the southeast, evidently questions about Crimea, and questions about the position assumed by Western countries. Surely, there will be some questions concerning the sanctions and Russia's response to them,"" the press secretary said. All ministries and agencies are providing the president with relevant information as part of preparations for the press conference. ""Without doubt, the whole array of information and the figures determining the main economic and social indicators are being updated very vigorously.

Questions about the 2014 Winter Olympic Games in Sochi may also be asked at the press conference, he said.

"ECONOMY: IMF-UKRAINE-RUSSIA Russia does not find it necessary to withdraw from IMF due to situation with Ukraine - Finance Minister MOSCOW, December 10. /TASS/. Russia does not find it necessary to withdraw from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) due to situation with Ukraine, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov told reporters on Thursday. ""I find it is not reasonable to withdraw from the fund,"" - he said. ""We are one of the key participants of the fund. We don’t find it necessary to withdraw from the fund because of a disputable situation which has emerged. We think that the IMF is conducting the right policy aimed at supporting balance of payments and budget of the countries, which need financial assistance,"" - Siluanov said. Earlier, President Vladimir Putin said that Russia was ready to restructure Ukraine’s $3 bln debt, if the US, the EU or a major international financial institution provide guarantees to Russia. But the guarantees were not provided. On December 8, the IMF Executive Board lifted the ban on provision of loans to the countries with overdue sovereign debts. The decision, in particular, means that the IMF will continue to implement its anti-crisis program for Ukraine even if Kiev fails to pay in time on its debt to Russia. This decision will also be extended to other situations where countries with sovereign debts, still enjoy the support of the fund. Russia’s Finance Ministry believes that the IMF took the decision only for Kiev, which agreed on the restructuring of commercial debt with all creditors but did not agree on the official loan it had received from Russia. On December 20, Ukraine is expected to fully pay its debt to Russia. If it fails, within 10 days after that date, Russia will go to court.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Editor's Note: Global Times reporter Chang Meng interviewed Russian Ambassador to China Andrey Denisov to discuss the current situation in Ukraine as Crimea prepares to go to the polls on Sunday in a vote that may dramatically influence the future of the region. GT: How will Russia administrate Crimea if it decides to join Russia after the Sunday referendum? How will Russia deal with it if the referendum has the opposite result? Denisov: It is too early to predict the results of the Sunday referendum. It is even more premature to contemplate Russia's actions with regard to the outcome. We reckon that only the people of Crimea have the right to determine their future and the future of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea. Nevertheless, we are closely monitoring the development of the situation. If the referendum brings that result [joining Russia] Crimea can turn to the Russian Federation with the proposition to accept the Republic of Crimea into the Russian Federation as a new constituent entity. In this case a respective interstate treaty between the Republic of Crimea and the Russian Federation would be needed, and if signed it should be approved by Russia's relevant authorities. So as you can see, the procedure is multilayered and quite complicated.   Today we can only observe the situation and state that Russia will fully respect any results of the free will of the Crimean people at the referendum. GT: If Ukraine eventually starts to turn to the Western camp, how will Russia handle the bilateral relations? Denisov: As President Putin said, Russia's position on the situation in Ukraine is consistent. Russia is interested in a stable and powerful Ukraine, where the legal rights and interests of the Ukrainians, our compatriots and all nationals are enforced. Russia has always considered Ukraine to not just be a neighbor but a fraternal state. Thus Russia is eager to maintain close ties with Ukraine under any circumstances. We believe that current instability in different regions of Ukraine is a direct consequence of careless actions by the new Ukrainian regime, which, in our perspective, is not fully legitimate. We advocate normalization of the situation in Ukraine and call for the fulfillment of the 21 February agreement, which would mean the formation of a legitimate national unity government considering the interests of all political forces, all nationalities and regions of the country. GT: How does Russia view and plan to tackle the sanction measures that the US and the EU have threatened to impose? What are their reasons for doing so? Denisov: Indeed, the Russian Government has been hearing certain threats to ""punish"" Russia for sticking to its principled line with regard to the settlement of the crisis in Ukraine. This aggrieves us a lot. These threats are obviously being used to put extra pressure on our country and to influence the Russian stance on some critical issues of international affairs. We consider such methods to be unconstructive and exacerbating tensions in bilateral and multilateral contact. Moreover if such sanctions are imposed, the harm will inevitably affect both sides and, according to many experts, Russia would not be the one who suffers more. GT: China has a close strategic partnership with Russia and holds the principle of non-intervention. As the ambassador, how do you view China's role in solving the Ukraine crisis? Denisov: Indeed, our bilateral relations with China have been on the incline. Despite the fact that they have always been very good, recently we can see a new drive for significant development. Today we may speak of ""new heights""in our cooperation in all fields. Leaders and foreign ministers of our countries have discussed the current crisis in Ukraine. We are very grateful to China for its balanced and principled position on this issue. Russia and China are making a significant contribution to international development and security. We hope that the closeness of our positions on Ukraine will become an important factor for stability in the region.  GT: Some observers see the crisis as a Cold War scar. How would different resolutions influence the international situation and also Russia's relations with the US and the EU? Denisov: The crisis in Ukraine has deep internal roots and is not about Russia-US or Russia-EU relationships. We regret that our Western partners are not always able to adequately perceive the changing reality and accept that it is not possible to impose their own will everywhere on the globe. Still we express our sincere hope that the situation in Ukraine will pacify soon, contacts with our American and European counterparts will become more productive, and contribute to the normalization of the crisis. GT: What is your comment regarding the recent postings on the official Sina Weibo account of your embassy, especially those refuting the moves of the US? Denisov: I know that some of the blog postings on the Russian Embassy official Sina Weibo have triggered a broad discussion among netizens and in media. All of those postings reflect the official position of the Russian Federation and are strictly in line with the statements recently made by Russian officials. I noticed that the online community was particularly interested in the statement by Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman A.Lukashevich commenting on the distortion of facts by the US Department of State. We are indeed concerned with some cases of applying ""double standards"" in international affairs and misinterpreting reality which only result in escalation of tensions around developments in Ukraine and Crimea. Thus we feel the need to provide the Chinese public with our insights and express our hope for more followers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"EU and Russia could work together if the Ukrainian conflict is frozen, Simeon Djankov, former deputy prime minister and minister of finance of Bulgaria said WASHINGTON, October 2 (RIA Novosti) - European Union and Russia could work together if the Ukrainian conflict is frozen and the European Commission is likely to respond to limiting of hostilities in Ukraine by lessening the sanctions regime against Russia, said Simeon Djankov, former deputy prime minister and minister of finance of Bulgaria. ""If you notice, literally in the last two weeks the discussion evolved from incoming President [of the European Commission, Jean-Claude] Juncker and a number of his commissioners has been on if there is a limit to the hostilities, if we reach a position of frozen conflict, then we can discuss how we and the Russians can work together,"" said Djankov at a Thursday Peterson Institute of International Economics event on global economics prospects. Djankov noted that this position was in stark contrast to statements made by EU officials in the summer saying that without a long-term solution, Russia would face increased sanctions. European economic sanctions have had a disproportionate impact on the EU's 28 member states and European businesses, said Djankov. He added that the European business leaders have voiced opposition to the sanctions. ""[They] have been saying the costs are disproportionately affecting our economies, so we are very unlikely in the future to go with other sanctions,"" he said. Further, he noted that those countries have been pressuring the incoming European Commissioners to explain under what conditions the current sanctions regime can start begin alleviated. Since Crimea vote to rejoin with Russia in March, the European Union, the United States and other western partners have levied sanctions against Russia on three separate occasions. The successful ceasefire negotiations that took place in Minsk, Belarus in early September have served as a confidence building measure, opening discussions of sanctions relief. In October, the European Commission is scheduled to discuss modifying Russian sanctions, an act that will require unanimous consent.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"EU links resumption of visa-free travel dialogue with Russia to normalization in Ukraine MOSCOW. Jan 15 (Interfax) - The European Union is prepared to resume the dialogue with Russia in various fields, including visa-free travel, Ukraine situation permitting, a European diplomat told Interfax. There are spheres of cooperation beyond sanctions, such as humanitarian contacts, cooperation between partners in the protection of human rights and civil society, he said in view of the EU foreign ministerial conference due on January 19. Speaking of the possibility to resume the visa-free travel dialogue between Russia and the European Union, the diplomat said it would be good if the Ukraine situation allowed the unlocking of various dialogue dimensions. Most importantly, the EU is ready for a new stage of relationship if the Ukraine situation permits this to happen, he emphasized. The diplomat added that the issue of anti-Russian sanctions was unlikely to be discussed by the EU foreign ministers on January 19. In the procedural sense, the sanctions will be discussed in March and July upon the expiry of the twelve-month period, the source noted. He also said it was much too early to say which decisions the EU foreign ministers might make.

"Excerpt from news report by Russian official state television channel Rossiya 1 on 5 June [Presenter, as part of report from Omsk on a ""social innovations forum""] We are now joined live by Federation Council speaker Valentina Matviyenko. Thank you, Valentina Ivanovna, for finding the time to talk to us. [Passage omitted: outline of agenda as suggested by the forum's title] [Presenter] Now as to Ukraine: What in your view is the latest act of provocation by Kiev's military [as fighting escalates in Ukraine's southeast] to do with? [Matviyenko (captioned)] Well, you know, it seems to me there is an explanation. As soon as the situation calms down, as soon as it starts to improve and talk starts whether the issue of whether to soften the sanctions or lift the sanctions against Russia needs to be considered, as if at the direction of a conductor new acts of provocation start. The aim is to create a negative information background and for no reason at all, without any foundation to blame the Russian Federation for the escalation of the situation. The Kiev authorities do not want to negotiate with the DPR and LPR [self-proclaimed ""Donetsk People's Republic"" and ""Luhansk People's Republic""]. We can see how they are in every way putting up new obstacles to the implementation of the political part of the Minsk accords. What is behind this is this: After all, they need to account to their own nation for what is happening in Ukraine, for the worsening of the economic situation, for the violation of human rights, for the persecution of dissidents, the violation of the rights of the mass media and simply for the total worsening of life for the citizens of Ukraine. They do not want to account for that, however. And, of course, another explanation is that there will be a G7 summit soon. There, of course, the issue of sanctions against Russia will be on the agenda. [Presenter] Thank you, Valentina Ivanovna. Federation Council speaker Valentina Matviyenko was answering our questions.

"Excerpt from report by RIA Novosti (part of the state-owned International News Agency Rossiya Segodnya); subheads are as published: Krasnodar, 17 December: Krasnodar Kray governor Aleksandr Tkachev believes that the slump in the exchange rate of the ruble is to a large extent ""manmade"", and it is Russia's payment for its position on the international arena, including for the incorporation of Crimea. [Passage omitted: summary of ruble slump, related financial development] Price of victory In Tkachev's view, both Western sanctions and the oil price drop had a political impact on the ruble rate and the macroeconomic state of the Russian economy. He described the oil price drop as a ""provoked and manmade strike"". He said it was an illusion to suppose that the West would put up with the incorporation of Crimea into Russia, and that our country would still ""remain steady and stable"". ""(The situation in the Russian economy) is the price, the challenge that we have to accept. Didn't we all applaud, didn't we all say it's great, well done, us, for making Crimea ours. This means we have to share not only the responsibility but also the burden, the losses,"" Tkachev said during the session of the territorial parliament on Wednesday [17 December]. Advantages and disadvantages In Tkachev's view, there are both advantages and disadvantages in the political challenge that Russia has made to the West. Thus for instance, he said, Krasnodar Kray, which he heads, now has the opportunity to improve its position in agriculture. Furthermore, he is convinced that in the current conditions the authorities have to develop medium and small business, the light and, as much as possible, the heavy industry. ""It will, however, take years,"" he admitted. Moreover, with the new interest rate rise, ""not a single enterprise will be able to develop and create a competitive product"". At the same time Tkachev is convinced that the state will direct all the resources to the suppression of inflationary pressures, the strengthening of the ruble and the return to an acceptable interest rate. ""This is quite a difficult time, which carries risks for our country, but the objective remains the same: we have to not only retain our potential but also think about growth, about creating new productions - no-one has scrapped this program,"" Tkachev said. He expects the situation on the currency market to start stabilizing before the New Year. ""We'll overcome these difficulties. And our choice in favor of Crimea, in favor of successful Olympics, was a conscious choice... We have a strong army, we have economic potential,"" Tkachev said, adding that Russia in 2000 and in 2014 was two different things.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
